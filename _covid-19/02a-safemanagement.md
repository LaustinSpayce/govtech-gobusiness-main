## General requirements

To ensure a safe working environment,  businesses are required to abide by the nation-wide general requirements for workplaces . Businesses are also required to adhere to the sector-specific requirements, and comply with measures to facilitate contact tracing.

All businesses should take note of the following:

- Employers must ensure that no more than 75% of employees who are able to work from home are at the workplace at any point in time. Employers are encouraged to support as many employees in working from home as possible, to reduce physical interactions in the workplace and minimise the spread of COVID-19.
- With more employees back in office, employers are also encouraged to stagger the start time for all employees and allow for flexible workplace hours. This will spread out staff across time and place and reduce possible congregation of employees at common spaces at or near the workplace as well as in public places, including public transport.
- Any applicable sector-specific requirements
