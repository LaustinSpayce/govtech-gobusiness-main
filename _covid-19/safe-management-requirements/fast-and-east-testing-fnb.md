This guide is updated as of 23 July 2021, 2000 hours. 

#### 1.	Mandatory Fast and Easy Testing (FET) for staff as we move towards a safe and gradual resumption of F&B dine-in Activities

    1.1	As announced by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on 18 June 2021, a Fast and Easy Testing (FET) regime will be progressively rolled out for all outlet employees at dine-in F&B establishments from 21 June 2021 onwards, and be mandatory from mid-July 2021.This is to further reduce the risk of transmission in settings with unmasked clients/patrons. These employees are required to be on a regular FET regime using tests such as the antigen rapid test (ART), regardless of their vaccination status.

    1.2	All dine-in F&B establishments (including restaurants, cafes, food courts, coffee shops, hawker stalls) must ensure that their outlet employees undergo FET every 14 days. This includes all full time and part time employees, as well as third-party contracted employees (e.g. cleaners) who work at the establishments. 

    1.3	This FET regime is being imposed under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations. Failure to comply with the requirements set out herein may result in prosecution and/or other enforcement action, including suspension/closure of operations .

    1.4	FET can be done through one of two ways:

    1.4.1.	F&B establishments such as restaurants, restaurants, cafes, food courts, coffee shops and canteens are encouraged to conduct Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (ESSS), where employees will swab themselves under the supervision of a trained staff (‘supervisor’). Supervision can be done either on-site at the workplace or virtually using tools such as video conferencing. To conduct ESSS, establishments will need to undergo training provided by the Government to supervise employees’ self-swabs. 

    1.4.2.	For small businesses in hawker centres that might not be able to organise the supervised self-swabs on their own, the relevant government agencies will progressively reach out to business owners and provide a sign up link for their employees to secure an appointment at Quick Test Centres (QTCs) . 

    1.5	For ESSS, ART kits will be provided. The costs for the kits and training for employees will be borne by the Government for 3 months, until 30 September 2021.

#### 2.	Employer-Supervised Self Swab (ESSS): Overview 

2.1.	For FET under Employer-Supervised Self Swab (ESSS), workers will swab themselves under the supervision of a trained staff (‘supervisor’). Supervision can be done either on-site at the workplace or virtually using tools such as video conferencing.

2.2.	The self swab can be done either at the workplace or at home, and will take approximately 10-15 minutes. 

2.3.	All employees must check for acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms prior to taking the self-swab. Only employees with no ARI symptoms should continue with the FET. Employees with ARI symptoms should not continue with the ART but instead consult a doctor for medical treatment immediately.
