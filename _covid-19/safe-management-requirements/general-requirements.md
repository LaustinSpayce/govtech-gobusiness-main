## General requirements

To ensure a safe working environment, businesses are required to abide by the [nation-wide general requirements for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Businesses are also required to adhere to the [sector-specific requirements](/safemanagement/sector/), and comply with [measures to facilitate contact tracing](/safemanagement/safeentry/).

All businesses should take note of the following:

- From 27 September 2021, Work-From-Home (WFH) will be the default for employees who are able to work from home. Employees who are unable to work from home are strongly encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).

- During this period, the snap 10-day work from home (10D WFH) regime will be suspended.

- There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites.

- Social gatherings at the workplace will continue to be disallowed.

- Employers should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours.

- Any applicable sector-specific requirements
