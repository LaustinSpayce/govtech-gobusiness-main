## General requirements

To ensure a safe working environment, businesses are required to abide by the [nation-wide general requirements for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Businesses are also required to adhere to the [sector-specific requirements](/safemanagement/sector/), and comply with [measures to facilitate contact tracing](/safemanagement/safeentry/).

All businesses should take note of the following:

- Employers must implement workforce vaccination measures to keep your workforce safe and minimise strain on our healthcare capacity. Only employees who are fully vaccinated, or recovered from COVID-19 in the past 180 days are allowed to enter the workplace.

- Up to 50% of employees who can work from home are allowed to return to the workplace. Those who report to work onsite are encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).

-  Social gatherings at the workplace must be limited to the prevailing group size of 5 persons.

- Employers and employees can refer to the [Updated Advisory on COVID-19 Vaccination at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details on work arrangements for unvaccinated employees. Employers may check their company's vaccination rate through [The Workforce Vaccination Checker](https://go.gov.sg/percentvaccinated){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} (Corppass login required).

- Any applicable sector-specific requirements
