## General requirements

To ensure a safe working environment, businesses are required to abide by the [nation-wide general requirements for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Businesses are also required to adhere to the [sector-specific requirements](/safemanagement/sector/), and comply with [measures to facilitate contact tracing](/safemanagement/safeentry/).

All businesses should take note of the following:

- Work-From-Home (WFH) is default for employees who are able to work from home. Employees who are unable to work from home are strongly encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).

- There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites.

- Social gatherings at the workplace will continue to be disallowed.

- Employers should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours.

- From 1 January 2022, employers must ensure that unvaccinated employees do not return to the workplace unless they have a negative ART administered via a Pre-Event Test (PET) at an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider 24 hours before the expect end of work. Employers and employees can refer to the [Updated Advisory on COVID-19 Vaccination at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details on work arrangements for unvaccinated employees. Employers may check their company's vaccination rate through [The Workforce Vaccination Checker](https://go.gov.sg/percentvaccinated){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} (Corppass login required).
