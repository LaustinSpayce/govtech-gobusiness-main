## General requirements

To ensure a safe working environment, businesses are required to abide by the [nation-wide general requirements for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Businesses are also required to adhere to the [sector-specific requirements](/safemanagement/sector/), and comply with [measures to facilitate contact tracing](/safemanagement/safeentry/).

All businesses should take note of the following:

- Employers must implement workforce vaccination measures to keep your workforce safe and minimise strain on our healthcare capacity. Only employees who are fully vaccinated, or recovered from COVID-19 in the past 180 days are allowed to enter the workplace.

- Up to 75% of employees who can work from home are allowed to return to the workplace. Those who report to work onsite are encouraged to self-test when they feel unwell or had recent contact with an infected person.

- For employees (and also contractors and vendors) who are physically onsite at the workplace, employers must ensure (a) Wear masks when indoors, except during activities that require masks to be removed. (b) In mask-off settings, there must be 1 metre between each group of up to 10 persons. Safe distancing is not required in mask-on settings (c) Social gatherings at the workplace are permitted, as long as the above requirements are adhered to.

- Employers and employees can refer to the [Updated Advisory on COVID-19 Vaccination at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details on work arrangements for unvaccinated employees. Employers may check their company's vaccination rate through [The Workforce Vaccination Checker](https://go.gov.sg/percentvaccinated){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} (Corppass login required).

- Any applicable sector-specific requirements
