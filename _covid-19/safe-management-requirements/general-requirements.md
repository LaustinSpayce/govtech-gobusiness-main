## General requirements

To ensure a safe working environment, businesses are required to abide by the [nation-wide general requirements for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Businesses are also required to adhere to the [sector-specific requirements](/safemanagement/sector/), and comply with [measures to facilitate contact tracing](/safemanagement/safeentry/).

All businesses should take note of the following:

- Work-From-Home (WFH) is default for employees who are able to work from home. Employees who are unable to work from home are strongly encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).

- There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites.

- Social gatherings at the workplace will continue to be disallowed.

- Employers should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours.

- From 1 January 2022, up to 50% of employees who can work from home are allowed to return to the workplace. Employers must ensure only the following employees can return to the workplace: (i) employees who are fully vaccinated with a vaccine under the National Vaccination Programme or WHO Emergency Use Listing and their respective post-vaccination duration, (ii) employees who have recovered from COVID-19 within the past 270 days, (iii) unvaccinated employees who have tested negative for COVID-19 within 24 hours of returning to the workplace, via a Pre-Event Test at an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider. Employees who are medically ineligible for all the vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme, including Sinovac, are exempted from the testing requirement above if they need to work on-site.

- Employers and employees can refer to the [Updated Advisory on COVID-19 Vaccination at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details on work arrangements for unvaccinated employees. Employers may check their company's vaccination rate through [The Workforce Vaccination Checker](https://go.gov.sg/percentvaccinated){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} (Corppass login required).

- Any applicable sector-specific requirements
