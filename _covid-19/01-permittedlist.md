## Permitted Services

The Government is currently allowing businesses to resume gradually in phases. As of 28 December 2020, we are currently in Phase 3. All businesses and self-employed persons in operation must comply with the safety management requirements [here](/safemanagement/general/) and sector-specific requirements [here](/safemanagement/sector/).

The list of services allowed to operate as of 19 June 2020, and their corresponding SSIC codes, can be found  [here](/images/covid/Permittedserviceslist2.pdf).

Please note that your SSIC code should correspond with the Primary Business Activity in your business registration records with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). You should ensure that your business activity is in line with your selected SSIC code.

If you do not know your SSIC code, you can login to [BizFile+](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} using your CorpPass credentials.
