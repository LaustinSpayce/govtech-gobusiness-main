## Permitted Services

The Government will allow the gradual resumption of businesses, in phases. Phase 1 commenced on 2 June 2020, and Phase 2 commenced on 19 June 2020. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced on 14 December 2020 that Singapore will commence Phase 3 on 28 December 2020.

All firms, bodies or self-employed persons who are in operation are to comply with the (1) safe management requirements listed [here](/safemanagement/general/) and (2) sector specific requirements listed [here](/safemanagement/sector/).

With effect from 19 June 2020, the list of permitted services and the corresponding SSIC codes that will be allowed to operate can be found [here](/images/Permittedserviceslist2.pdf).

Please note that firms, bodies or self-employed persons that have been permitted to operate as at 18 Jun will be allowed to continue to carry on their operations.

Please note that your SSIC code should correspond with the “primary business activity” in your business registration records with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). You should ensure that your business activity is in line with your selected SSIC code.

If you do not know your SSIC code, you can login to <a href="https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/" target="_blank">BizFile+</a> using your CorpPass credentials.
