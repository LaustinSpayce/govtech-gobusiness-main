## Time-Limited 8-weeks Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) for workplaces

[Updated 27 Dec] As more employees return to the workplace from 1 Jan 2022, there could be higher risk of workplace transmission, particularly given the higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant. To ensure early detection and ringfencing of COVID-19 infections, we encourage all firms to implement regular testing for all employees. The Government will therefore conduct <b>a second round of Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kit distribution to workplaces</b>. Similar to the first round of distribution in Sep/Oct 2021, this time-limited 8-weeks RRT exercise is voluntary and will be on an application basis. Application will open from 3 January 2021 through to 31 January 2021.

Firms with <b>fully vaccinated employees who work onsite</b> and who <b>are not already under the Government’s mandatory Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or Fast and Easy Testing (FET) RRT regime</b>, will be eligible to apply for 8 ART kits per onsite fully vaccinated employee for weekly testing over a two-month period. These tests can be self-administered by staff either at home, or at the work premises.

### [Round 2 of Time-Limited RRT] Eligibility Criteria

- Staff should be fully vaccinated, and not be on any mandatory Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or Fast and Easy Testing (FET) RRT
    - Companies should exclude non-fully vaccinated staff, as well as staff on mandatory RRT regime, from their application for ART kits.
    - Companies may apply for ART kits for staff who are certified to be medically ineligible. 
- Staff should physically return to office, worksite or any off-site premises at least once a week, for work purposes (i.e. does not work from home full-time). This includes staff on hybrid work arrangements and who will return to office. Staff who are on 100% work from home arrangement would not qualify for the kits.
    - Includes full-time and part-time employees, regular vendors/contractors, students on long-term (at least 2 months) placement or internship. 

### [Round 2 of Time-Limited RRT] Application Details

The application period is from 3 Jan 2021 to 31 Jan 2021. More details will be provided before application begins on 3 Jan 2021. 

### Compliance & Results Declaration

Firms that have applied for and receive the ART kits are required to have processes in place to ensure that tests are conducted properly every week for all onsite employees, test results are recorded, and appropriate follow-up protocols are adhered to. Firms should retain proof of such processes and test results, and to produce these proof when audited by the government. 

Firms are required to submit their ART results declaration at the end of each month’s testing cycle (i.e. twice across the two-month period) to the government. For firms who have applied and receive the ART kits for the first round of Time-Limited kit distribution in September/October 2021, they should submit the ART results declaration via this link: [https://go.gov.sg/time-limited-rrt-art-results-declaration](https://go.gov.sg/time-limited-rrt-art-results-declaration){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} 

Firms who have applied and received the ART kits for the first round of Time-Limited kit distribution in September/October 2021 may have discontinued or deferred testing due to full work-from-home arrangements announced by the Government in end-Sep 2021. In such cases, firms should still submit any test results they had collected (or relevant justification if there are no test results) at the end of each month for the two-months period starting from the date of receipt of kits. Once WFH is no longer the default, companies are advised to re-commence testing upon return to office and continue submitting results until testing is complete.   
  
The Government shall have the right to claw back the cost of any test kits should any of the information submitted in the application form or results declaration form are found to be untrue, or if any non-compliance to the testing requirements are found.
