#### **1. SafeEntry**

![SafeEntry](/images/covid/SafeEntry_logo_inline.png "SafeEntry")

SafeEntry is a free-for-use Cloud-based visitor registration system. Visitors scan a QR code using their SingPass Mobile app, give consent to share their name and contact information with the building managers, and make the necessary declaration required. This online service will be regularly updated to reflect the latest advisory and guidelines. Using this system allows businesses to verify user identity with data from Government sources to facilitate their tracing work should the need arise.

All businesses and services that are in operation must institute SafeEntry for their employees, associates and vendors. In addition, they must also use the SafeEntry system to log the check-in of customers, clients, students, visitors entering their premises.

Retail outlets where customers are unlikely to be in close proximity for a prolonged period of time, such as pharmacies, convenience stores and heartland provision shops, are encouraged, but not required, to implement SafeEntry for customers.

All premises, including small retail outlets, must still implement SafeEntry for employees, associates and vendors as per all workplaces, and adhere strictly to the other safe management measures, e.g. safe distancing.

Please note that the methods for SafeEntry can and will change depending on the state of affairs in Singapore in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Permitted enterprises are advised to stand ready to adapt entry arrangements to their premises to new methods if they want to be confident in meeting statutory requirements.

SafeEntry via TraceTogether only (or TraceTogether-only SafeEntry) is a new protocol consisting of check-ins only through the use of the TraceTogether App or Token and is being planned for roll-out soon.

When TraceTogether-only SafeEntry is rolled out nationwide, supermarkets and retail outlets (regardless of size) that are fully within malls and buildings covered by TraceTogether-only SafeEntry and have the same operating hours will no longer be required to implement SafeEntry nor TraceTogether-only SafeEntry for customers, clients and visitors.

#### **2. TraceTogether-only SafeEntry**

With TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, visitors where visitors scan a QR code with their TraceTogether app or present their TraceTogether Token for scanning to register a SafeEntry check-in. When TraceTogether-only SafeEntry is in effect, check-in using SingPass Mobile and QR code reader mobile applications will no longer be accepted.

For individuals entering premises where TraceTogether-only SafeEntry is implemented as a safe management measure, they have to use either their TraceTogether app or TraceTogether Token, and not any other method, to check in to the venue’s SafeEntry system.

Permitted businesses are advised to make the necessary preparations to accept TraceTogether Token check-ins. To learn more, please visit SafeEntry's website <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/tracetgt">here</a>.

#### **3. TraceTogether**

TraceTogether is a programme to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through community-driven contact tracing.

##### How it works
Both the TraceTogether app and the TraceTogether Token work by exchanging short-distance Bluetooth signals between other nearby TraceTogether devices. These devices estimate the distance between users, and the duration of the such encounters. These records are stored locally and encrypted for 25 days, to cover the incubation period of the virus as well as the time taken for individuals to seek treatment and get tested for COVID-19. After the 25-day period, the data is automatically deleted.

If a user is interviewed by a contact tracer for activity mapping, he can authorise the uploading of his TraceTogether data to Ministry of Health (MOH). MOH will then decipher the data and get the mobile numbers of the user’s close contacts within a period of time. This facilitates the contact tracing process, and enables contact tracers to inform close contacts of confirmed cases more quickly.
