#### 1. SafeEntry

![SafeEntry](/images/covid/SafeEntry_logo_inline.png "SafeEntry")

SafeEntry is a free-for-use Cloud-based visitor registration system. Visitors scan a QR code using their SingPass Mobile app, give consent to share their name and contact information with the building managers, and make the necessary declaration required. This online service will be regularly updated to reflect the latest advisory and guidelines. Using this system allows businesses to verify user identity with data from Government sources to facilitate their tracing work should the need arise.

Business and building owners can find out more [here](https://go.gov.sg/travelhealthdeclare){:target="_blank"}.

All businesses and services that are in operation must institute SafeEntry for their employees, associates and vendors. Of the businesses/services that are allowed to be in operation, the following list of facilities/places must also deploy the SafeEntry system to log the check-in of customers, clients, students and visitors entering their premises.

- Workplaces e.g. offices, factories
- Schools and educational institute
- Preschools and student care centres
- Healthcare facilities e.g. hospitals, clinics, TCM clinics, complementary healthcare facilities
- Residential and community-based care facilities e.g. nursing homes, Senior Activity Centres, Senior Care Centres, Day Activity Centres for Persons with Disabilities    
- Places of worship
- Funeral parlours
- Hotels
- Banks and financial institutions
- Retail, personal and food & beverage (F&B) services
  - Malls
  - Supermarkets
  - Selected popular wet markets (Geylang Serai Market, Block 104 / 105 Yishun Ring Road (Chong Pang Market), Block 20/21 Marsiling Lane, and Block 505 Jurong West Street 52)
  - F&B outlets for dine-in customers
  - Large retail outlets (> 930 sqm or 10,000 sqft)   
  - Personal care services e.g. hairdressers / barbers, spas, beauty and wellness centres
  - Facilities providing basic pet services (that do not function on a drop-off, pick-up basis)
- Tuition and enrichment, training centres, and other training/ class venues
- Sports and recreation
  - Sports and fitness centres, including gyms, studios
  - Country and recreation clubs, and registered premises of other member clubs/ societies
- Cultural and entertainment venues
  - Libraries
  - Museums, exhibitions, and showrooms
  - Cinemas, attractions, and other entertainment venues  
- Home-based businesses that involve customers entering one’s home for a prolonged period, e.g. private dining, hairdressing services
- Event venues e.g. function halls/ rooms, event lawns  

SafeEntry has been progressively rolled out to taxis since 12 May 2020 to better support contact tracing efforts for street-hail trips. All commuters who get onto the taxi should scan the SafeEntry QR codes deployed in taxis when taking street-hail trips.

Retail outlets where customers are unlikely to be in close proximity for a prolonged period of time, such as pharmacies, convenience stores and heartland provision shops, are encouraged, but not required, to implement SafeEntry for customers.

For avoidance of doubt, all premises, including small retail outlets, must still implement SafeEntry for employees, associates and vendors as per all workplaces, and adhere strictly to the other safe management measures (eg: safe distancing).

*This list will be updated as more activities and services are resumed.

#### 2. SafeEntry Gateway

SafeEntry Gateway will be progressively introduced as an additional mode of SafeEntry check-in. This follows a 5-month trial at selected locations, including Downtown East.

The SafeEntry Gateway enables contactless detection of both the TraceTogether App and Token, and serves as an additional means of SafeEntry check-in that is quicker and more seamless. It also allows users to check if their Token has run out of battery or is not working.

The SafeEntry Gateway is available both as a physical device and as an app function in the existing SafeEntry (Business) App. Both the device and app function by detecting Bluetooth signals from the TraceTogether App and TraceTogether Token for SafeEntry check-in. Visitors may bring their mobile phone with the TraceTogether App in the foreground or the TraceTogether Token close to the Gateway to check in. If the check-in is successful, the SafeEntry Gateway device will emit a green light and a beep sound to indicate a successful check-in, while the SafeEntry (Business) App will have a pop-out screen for a successful check-in.

From 19 April 2021, the following public-facing venues are required to deploy SafeEntry Gateway at their main entrances as an additional check-in mode to log the check-in of customers, clients and visitors:

- Malls
- Large retail outlets (> 930 sqm or 10,000 sqft)
- Selected popular wet markets (Geylang Serai Market, Block 104 / 105 Yishun Ring Road (Chong Pang Market), Block 20/21 Marsiling Lane, and Block 505 Jurong West Street 52)
- Supermarkets*
- Public libraries
- Selected museums, heritage institutions, and galleries**
- Cinemas (Golden Village, Cathay Cineplexes, Shaw Theatres, Filmgarde, WE Cinemas, The Projector, Eaglewing Cinematics, Carnival Cinemas and Salt Media@Capital Tower)
- Gated tourist attractions
- MICE event venues (hotels/convention centres with events for >100pax)
- Places of worship (worship services for >100pax)
- Public and Private Hospitals, National Specialty Centres, Community Hospitals and Polyclinics
- Funeral parlours with wake halls

Businesses may deploy either the SafeEntry Gateway device or the SafeEntry (Business) App based on their business needs.

*Supermarkets and large retail outlets located inside buildings already covered by SafeEntry Gateway (e.g. malls or commercial buildings), with the same operating hours, will not be required to deploy SafeEntry Gateways. Please note that all supermarkets and large retail outlets must continue to implement SafeEntry, regardless of whether they are located inside buildings covered by SafeEntry Gateways

**Selected public museums, heritage institutions, and galleries will be informed by National Heritage Board.

#### 3. TraceTogether

![TraceTogether](/images/covid/tracetogether_logo.png "TraceTogether")

TraceTogether is a mobile app that supports Singapore's efforts to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through community-driven contact tracing.

**How it works**

Both the TraceTogether app and the TraceTogether Token work by exchanging short-distance Bluetooth signals between other nearby TraceTogether devices. These devices estimate the distance between users, and the duration of the such encounters. These records are stored locally and encrypted for 25 days, to cover the incubation period of the virus as well as the time taken for individuals to seek treatment and get tested for COVID-19. After the 25-day period, the data is automatically deleted.

If a user is interviewed by a contact tracer for activity mapping, he can authorise the uploading of his TraceTogether data to Ministry of Health (MOH). MOH will then decipher the data and get the mobile numbers of the user’s close contacts within a period of time. This facilitates the contact tracing process, and enables contact tracers to inform close contacts of confirmed cases more quickly.
