    <u>For all business owners except new business owners in the food services industry</u>  
    The right option, Self-Service feature (previously called LicenceOne) is for you, if you:
      - Have previously applied for licences or created application drafts on LicenceOne
      - Are a new business owner from any industry except food services

      <u>For new food services business owners</u>  
      The left option, Guided Journey feature, is for business owners in the food services industry, especially new ones who have not applied for any licences before. Guided Journey will walk you through the step-by-step process of applying for the licences your business needs. It is currently for food services businesses only (except standalone food stalls), and will be made available to other industries in future.

      If you are still not sure which option to select, please contact us here.
