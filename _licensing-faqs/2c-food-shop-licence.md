  - title: I am a foreigner with a valid employment pass issued by Ministry of Manpower. Can I apply for the licence in my name?
    content: |
      No. You will need to form a company that is registered with the Accounting & Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and apply for the licence in the company's name.

  - title: Whose name should the Food Shop Licence be in if I plan to hire foreign workers?
    content: |
      To employ foreign workers, you must apply for work passes from the Ministry of Manpower. Please request for the Food Shop Licence to be issued in the name of the body corporate.

    content: |
      You can still submit your application together with all supporting documents. However, for such cases, SFA will need to write to the previous licensee to confirm whether he is still operating the business at the said premises.

The processing time for such cases is about two weeks.

      - We will respond to you within five working days upon receipt of the application.

      - If the application is incomplete without basic details of applicant and layout plan of premises, you will be informed to furnish the information within two weeks. Upon furnishing the information, we will notify you on the requirements to comply for your application.

      - After notification of the requirements, you may commence the set up or renovation of your premises according to the layout plan submitted in the application.

      - Once completed, please inform the licensing officer to arrange for a pre-licensing site inspection to verify compliance.

      - SFA will issue an approval letter to you within five working days after the pre-licensing inspection if everything is in order. This letter will also serve as notification to you to collect the licence.
