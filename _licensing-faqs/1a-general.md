## About Licensing FAQ

#### 1. Iâ€™m not sure how to choose between the two options on the GoBusiness Licensing homepage. Where can I get help?

**For all business owners except new business owners in the food services industry**

The right option, Self-Service feature (previously called LicenceOne) is for you, if you:
- Have previously applied for licences or created application drafts on LicenceOne
- Are a new business owner from any industry except food services

**For new food services business owners**

The left option, Guided Journey feature, is for business owners in the food services industry, especially new ones who have not applied for any licences before. Guided Journey will walk you through the step-by-step process of applying for the licences your business needs. It is currently for food services businesses only (except standalone food stalls), and will be made available to other industries in future.

If you are still not sure which option to select, please contact us here.

#### 2. I was trying to access LicenceOne and got redirected here. Why?

LicenceOne has been rebranded and is now known as GoBusiness Licensing. The Self-Service feature has all the same functions as LicenceOne and we have also added the new Guided Journey feature to walk beginners through the licensing process.

This feature is currently only available for food & beverage businesses, and we are working on expanding this to other industries. In our mission to make the licensing process simpler, better and faster, we will be rolling out further enhancements to the Self-Service feature in phases.

#### 3. What's the difference between Guided Journey and Self-Service?

Guided Journey is a newly added feature that provides step-by-step guidance for business owners to find out the licences they need, and apply for them. This feature is currently only available for food & beverage businesses that fall under this list.

If you are already familiar with the licensing process and would like to do it on your own, you can select Self-Service to apply and pay for the licences you need, as well as update, renew or terminate them.

#### 4. How do I log in?

You will need to log in to GoBusiness Licensing with CorpPass. You can register for a CorpPass ID here.

In order to use GoBusiness Licensing, your company's CorpPass Administrator or Sub-Administrator will need to assign digital service access to GoBusiness Portal. You can find out how to do so here.

#### 5. Why is the Guided Journey feature only available for F&B businesses?

GoBusiness Licensing is in its launch phase and we are currently working towards extending this feature to more industries in future.
