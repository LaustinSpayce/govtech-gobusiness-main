  - title: I was trying to access LicenceOne and got redirected here. Why?
    content: LicenceOne has been rebranded and is now known as GoBusiness Licensing. The Self-Service feature has all the same functions as LicenceOne and we have also added the new Guided Journey feature to walk beginners through the licensing process.<br><br>This feature is currently only available for food & beverage businesses, and we are working on expanding this to other industries. In our mission to make the licensing process simpler, better and faster, we will be rolling out further enhancements to the Self-Service feature in phases.
