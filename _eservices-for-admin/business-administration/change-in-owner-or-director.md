## Change in owner or director

![Change in owner or director](/images/eservices/eServices_Change in Owner or Director.jpg)

If there are changes in business owners or authorised representatives, you will need to update Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) within 14 days of the change. The endorsement of the other business owners (if any) is also required.

Learn more about it at [ACRA's website](https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/updating-information-of-sole-proprietorships-and-partnerships/changes-in-business-information-and-appointments-of-business-owners-and-authorised-representatives){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

### Updating your licences and grants

Some business licences and grants may require up-to-date business ownership information in order to remain valid.

Please check with the governing agencies for your licences if an update is required, and how the update should be made.
