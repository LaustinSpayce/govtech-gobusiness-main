      Safe management measures for tuition and enrichment are aligned with national guidelines available at [Ministry of Health's website](http://moh.gov.sg/covid-19){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

      Centres that continue on-site instructions are required to abide by the nationwide safe management measures for workplaces. More information can be found on [Ministry of Manpower's website](http://mom.gov.sg/covid-19){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

      Centres must also abide by other sector-specific safe management measures available on [GoBusiness' website](/covid/). 

      Prevailing circulars issued by the Government, and the latest guidance on improving ventilation and indoor air quality in buildings can be found on [National Environment Agency's website](http://nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/advisories/guidance-on-improving-ventilation-and-indoor-air-quality-in-buildings-amid-the-covid-19-situation){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
