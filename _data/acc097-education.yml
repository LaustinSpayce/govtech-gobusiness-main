  - title: What types of classes need to be suspended, given the tighter safe distancing measures announced on 16 May 2021? 
    content: |
      All organisations and individuals offering tuition and enrichment activities, whether academic or non-academic, must suspend in-person lessons to students aged 12 and younger (i.e. born in 2009 or after),  from 27 September 2021 to 10 October 2021 (both dates inclusive). This includes but is not limited to education and development support activities, arts and culture classes and workshops, religious classes, as well as sports and physical activity classes and programmes. The decision to suspend in-person tuition and enrichment classes is to better protect our younger students who are not yet medically eligible for vaccination, particularly with the higher risk of transmission of COVID-19 caused by intermingling of students from different schools. This is also in line with primary schools’ move to Home-Based Learning during this period.

      The above applies to all organisations and individuals offering tuition and enrichment classes (including centre-based classes, home-based businesses, as well as one-on-one classes), except for the following which may continue on-site instruction, subject to prevailing safe management measures:

      a.	Interventions and assessment services for students provided by therapists regulated by the Allied Health Professions Council or psychologists registered with the Singapore Psychological Society’s Register of Psychologists, in alignment with MOH guidelines on healthcare services; and

      b.	Early Intervention (EI) programmes and centres that provide allied health, psychological and/or specialised intervention services to children with developmental needs aged 6 and below, subject to prevailing safe management measures.

      For avoidance of doubt, Early Childhood Development Centres licensed by ECDA, and student care centres may continue to provide care to children, subject to prevailing safe management measures. On-site instruction provided in the course of this care will also be permitted.

      Organisations and individuals may continue to offer in-person tuition and enrichment activities to students older than 12 years old, subject to prevailing safe management measures. Nevertheless, MOE strongly encourages that these classes be conducted online.

  - title: Will private tutors operating out of private residences be required to suspend their lessons?
    content: |
      All home-based tuition/enrichment must shift their classes for students aged 12 and younger (i.e. born in 2009 or after)  online or otherwise suspend lessons from 27 September 2021 to 10 October 2021 (both dates inclusive). While in-person classes for students older than 12 years old may continue, MOE strongly encourages that these classes be conducted online.

      Home-based tuition/enrichment which is allowed to continue in-person lessons is subject to the prevailing national group size limit and number of unique household visitors allowed per day. In addition, home ventilation should be improved by opening doors and windows. Fans can be used to promote air circulation when needed.

      More information about safe management measures for home-based services are available at the MOH [website](https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19/faqs){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

  - title: Will in-person classes catering exclusively to students older than 12 years old, including Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses for adults be allowed to continue?   
    content: |
      Yes, in-person classes catering exclusively to students older than 12 years old may continue in person, subject to prevailing safe management measures. However, MOE strongly encourages that these classes be conducted online.

  - title: I am an operator of a business providing activities to both school-going children and adults. Is my business subjected to the suspension?
    content: |
      The suspension applies to in-person private tuition and enrichment classes for students aged 12 and younger (i.e. born in 2009 or after), to better protect our younger students who are not yet medically eligible for vaccination, particularly with the higher risk of transmission of COVID-19 caused by intermingling of students from different schools.  

      In-person classes catering exclusively to students older than age 12 will be allowed to continue, subject to prevailing safe management measures. However, MOE strongly encourages that these classes be conducted online.

  - title: What are the workforce arrangements that should be implemented for tuition and enrichment centres that are suspended?
    content: |
      In line with the national posture, all tuition and enrichment centres must ensure that work-from-home is the default arrangement for employees who are able to do so. During this period, the 10-day snap work-from-home regime will be suspended. For employees who must return to the workplace (e.g. to maintain critical IT functions), tuition and enrichment centres are required to abide by all prevailing safe management measures for workplaces (refer to Q6 for more info on these safe management measures).

      In line with the national posture, all tuition and enrichment centres must ensure that work-from-home is the default arrangement for employees who are able to do so. During this period, the 10-day snap work-from-home regime will be suspended. MOE strongly encourages that all tuition and enrichment classes be conducted online. 

      For centres that are allowed to continue on-site instruction, to reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19, they are required to abide by the nationwide [safe management measures for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. These include the use of SafeEntry to support contact tracing for all employees, wearing of masks at all times, no social gatherings at the workplace and regular cleaning of common facilities and high-touch areas. Employers should continue to implement flexible working hours and stagger the start times of employees who need to return to the workplace. For employees who are able to work from home but need to return to the workplace for adhoc reasons may do so after testing negative via  the Antigen Rapid Test before returning onsite. Details are available at the GoBusiness [website](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/general/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. 

      As part of Singapore’s national efforts to mitigate the risk of transmission of COVID-19, enterprises in the Private Tuition and Enrichment Sector are required to comply with the FET 7-day regime, as well as the VoRT regime for onsite employees. The latest details on the two regimes are on: https://go.gov.sg/tuition-enrichment-fet. 
      
      As a default, the following SMMs apply to all centres conducting on-site instruction (whether indoors or outdoors and regardless of activity), except where there are additional safe management measures that apply for higher-risk activities such as sports or physical activity, dance, singing, the playing of instruments that require the intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind/brass instruments), voice training, and speech and drama classes (please refer to Q7 and Q8 for details for these classes).

      a. **Safe distancing.** Safe distancing measures for centres which are allowed to continue on-premise instruction are:

        i. <u>Students:</u> Centres must ensure safe distancing between students by putting up appropriate floor demarcations and/or physical barriers, e.g. using safety tape. There must also be strict separation between students in different classrooms at all times, with no intermingling.
          <br>- As a default, centres must ensure that all students maintain safe distancing of at least 1m at all times, with strictly no physical interaction between students. 
          <br>- If it is not possible to apply 1m safe distancing between students and some interaction is unavoidable, centres may instead organise students into groups of no more than 2 **<u>students</u>**, with strictly no physical interaction or intermingling between different groups. Centres must strictly maintain a minimum of 1m spacing between groups, although MOE advises 2m spacing between groups as a best practice.

        ii. <u>Tutors/instructors:</u> Tutors/instructors are advised to minimise contact with students. If some interaction is unavoidable, contact with students should be transient, and they should remain at the front of the class as much as is practicable.

        iii. <u>Capacity:</u> No single room within a centre should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors, even as the above measures are adopted.

        iv. Centres are also reminded that per MOM’s guidelines for workplaces, should there be staff deployed on site, centres must strictly ensure that there is  be no cross-deployment across worksites. No staff should work at more than one worksite to reduce the risk of infection caused by inter-mingling. More information on prevailing workplace SMMs can be found on the MOM website ([https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

      b. **Health declarations.** Centres should not permit students who are placed on Leave of Absence (LOA) or Approved Absence (AA) by their schools, or students and staff who are on Health Risk Warning (HRW), Health Risk Alert (HRA), Stay Home Notice (SHN), or Home Quarantine Order (HQO) to enter the centre. We also advise centres to watch out for staff and students with fever or respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, breathlessness, runny nose, loss of sense of smell, cough, or sore throat. Staff and students with the above symptoms or who are unwell should be advised to leave the centre and see a doctor immediately, and should not be allowed to attend lessons. As a best practice, centres should also check if a family member living in the same household is unwell. If so, the child should not attend lessons in person.

      c. **Disinfection of surfaces.** All surfaces in classrooms must be thoroughly disinfected between classes. Sharing of all equipment (e.g. props, microphones) should be avoided as far as possible. If this cannot be done, the equipment should be thoroughly cleaned and/or disinfected before being handled or used by others. However, please note that sharing of wind/brass instruments or parts thereof (e.g. mouthpieces, reeds) is not allowed.

      d. **Masks must be worn as a default at all times,** except for persons allowed to use face shields instead of masks (e.g. persons with health conditions resulting in breathing/medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period). Instructors are expected to wear a surgical mask or reusable masks of equivalent effectiveness at all times.

      e. **Class timings.** Centres must allocate at least 15 minutes between classes. This is to allow adequate time to disinfect classroom surfaces, and to ensure strict separation of individuals from different classes. Centres should also work out attendance and dismissal arrangements that help avoid congestion of individuals in or outside the centre. 

      f. **Ventilation.** All premises should abide by the latest guidance on improving ventilation and indoor air quality in buildings amid the COVID-19 situation, available on the [NEA website](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/advisories/guidance-on-improving-ventilation-and-indoor-air-quality-in-buildings-amid-the-covid-19-situation){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

      Centres should also abide by other sector-specific Safe Management Measures available on the [GoBusiness website](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector/), and to prevailing circulars issued by the Government.

  - title: Some tuition and enrichment classes involve high movement activities (e.g. sports, dance), or activities which carry a higher risk of virus transmission through droplet spread (e.g. singing, wind/brass instruments). What additional safe management measures should be implemented?
    content: |
      Additional safe management measures may apply for these classes, subject to different class size and group size limits, depending on the activity, setting, and vaccination status of students. 

      For all sport or physical activity classes, as well as outdoor dance classes, please refer to the advisory issued by [Sport Singapore](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/Newsroom/Media-Releases){:target="_blanks"}.

      For indoor dance classes, singing, the playing of instruments that require the intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind/brass instruments), voice training, and speech and drama classes, please refer to the advisory issued by the [National Arts Council](https://www.nac.gov.sg/whatwedo/support/sustaining-the-arts-during-covid-19/Safe-Management-Measures-for-the-Arts-and-Culture-Sector-.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

      All coaches, instructors and staff who come into contact with participants/students who are engaged in unmasked activities, including but not limited to dance, singing, the playing of instruments that require the intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind/brass instruments), voice, theatre training (including speech and drama, actor training), physical education and other sports-related activities are required to undergo FET. For more details on the implementation of FET, please refer to the notification issued by [National Arts Council](https://www.nac.gov.sg/whatwedo/support/sustaining-the-arts-during-covid-19/Fast-and-Easy-Testing-for-Higher-Risk-Arts-Instruction-Activities.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, and the notification issued by [ActiveSG](https://www.myactivesg.com/read/2021/7/a-safe-and-gradual-resumption-of-sport-and-fitness-activities-with-mandatory-fast-and-easy-testing){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

  - title: What are the additional safe management measures for classes that involve mask-off activities?
    content: |
      All activities involving mask-off activities are subject to additional safe management measures (on top of the prevailing safe management measures that all classes are required to comply with).

      - For outdoor classes, the class size must be limited to a maximum of 50 persons (including the instructor), with group sizes of no more than **<u>2 persons</u>**. 

        - There must be at least 1m safe distance between individuals who are masked. For individuals who are unmasked, they must maintain a 2m safe distance with the next individual. 
        - Additionally, there must be a minimum of 3m spacing between each group. The groups should not intermingle before, during, and after the class.

      - For indoor classes, class size must be limited to a maximum of 50 persons (including the instructor), with:

        - Group sizes of no more than **<u>2 persons</u>**, provided that all individuals in the class are vaccinated. 
        - There must be at least 1m safe distance between individuals who are masked. For individuals who are unmasked, they must maintain a 2m safe distance with the next individual. 
        - Additionally, there must be a minimum of 3m spacing between each group. The groups should not intermingle before, during, and after the class.  

      - Where there are individuals who are not vaccinated, indoor classes **<u>are to be suspended.</u>**

      An individual is considered vaccinated if he/ she has been:

      a. Fully vaccinated, i.e. has received the full regimen of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnatry, Moderna or World Health Organisation’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines, with an additional two weeks for the vaccine to be fully effective; 

      b. Recovered from COVID-19; or 

      c. Has obtained a negative result on a pre-event test taken in the past 24 hours before the expected end of the event.

  - title: Can tuition and enrichment centres that are allowed to conduct face-to-face classes switch to online learning?
    content: |
      Yes, tuition and enrichment centres providing face-to-face classes can consider switching to online lessons. Centres should review the safe management measures that they are able to put in place and can make their own business decisions regarding the conduct of online learning, taking into consideration the efficacy of instruction and the needs and expectations of students/parents.

  - title: Can employees of private tuition and enrichment centres continue to work at the workplace, even if centres have switched to online learning?
    content: |
      Tuition and enrichment centres are required to abide by the nationwide safe management measures for workplaces. Tele-conferencing should be used in place of in-person meetings as far as possible. Where employees can perform their work by telecommuting from home, employers must ensure that they do so. 

  - title: Are private schools, including tuition and enrichment centres, allowed to hold year-end concerts or performances on their premises?
    content: |
      All indoor live performances by tuition and enrichment centres should continue to be deferred/postponed until further notice, to reduce the risk of transmission.

  - title: Are all tutors/instructors/staff at private tuition or enrichment centres required to undergo Fast and Easy Testing (FET) or the Vaccinate or Regular Test (VoRT) regimes?
    content: |
      As part of Singapore’s national efforts to mitigate the risk of transmission of COVID-19, enterprises in the Private Tuition and Enrichment Sector are required to comply with the FET 7-day regime, as well as the VoRT regime. The latest details on the two regimes are on: https://go.gov.sg/tuition-enrichment-fet.

  - title: Will Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses for adults be allowed to continue?
    content: |
      All training providers are strongly encouraged to continue conducting CET training online.

      For health and safety reasons, the maximum class size for all other in-person CET activities is capped at 50 persons (including the trainer(s)). For SSG-funded CET programmes, SSG’s prevailing guideline for a maximum class size of 40 persons (excluding the trainer(s)) for course quality reasons remains and takes precedence. This is subject to safe management requirements in Q6, and additional safe management measures for high-risk activities in Q8 as applicable. For all other sport or physical activity, dance, singing, the playing of instruments that require the intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind/brass instruments), voice training, speech and drama classes, please refer to Q7.

  - title: Can private tuition/enrichment classes and training sessions be held in external venues (e.g. function rooms)?
    content: |
      Private tuition/enrichment classes, and training sessions by the Institutes of Higher Learning and SSG-funded training providers, can be conducted at external venues, if those venues are open. Such external venues may include condominium function rooms, private conference and meeting rooms, etc. 

      Conduct of in-person lessons is subject to premise capacity caps and safe management measures(please refer to Q2). Private providers should approach premise owners for advice on the capacity caps for their respective venues. No single room should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors/trainers, subject to further capacity limits for masked sports/dance/speech/voice training/drama classes, or the premise capacity cap, <u>whichever is lower.</u> 

      There should be a wipe-down regimen after each use at such external venues. Private providers must also adhere to the safe management guidelines for private tuition/enrichment and CET courses, which are outlined in the FAQs within this section.

  - title: I am a private provider / Allied Health Professional offering services for students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) or disabilities. May I provide services and what are the safe management measures that I need to adhere to?
    content: |
      Registered Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) defined as professionals regulated by the Allied Health Professions Council and psychologists registered with the Singapore Psychological Society’s Register of Psychologists can continue to provide consultation and assessment services for students (aged 7-12) with special educational needs or disabilities.  These AHPs should adhere to sector-specific guidelines, prevailing precautionary measures and safe distancing requirements, as well as infection and control measures such as hand hygiene and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) guidelines relevant to each setting.   

      For Early Intervention (EI) services provided to pre-school children (aged 0 - 6), please refer to ECDA’s guidelines on EI services.  

      In addition to aligning with MOH guidelines on healthcare services, group therapy for all non-public Healthcare Institutions AHS, including psychology services, is capped at a maximum of 2 clients per session (count excludes AHPs and support staff).

      For other face-to-face services, MOE requires that all organisations and individuals offering tuition and enrichment activities must suspend in-person lessons for students aged 12 and younger (i.e. born in 2009 or after), from 27 September 2021 to 10 October 2021 (both dates inclusive). These lessons can continue to be conducted online.

  - title: Will the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system and the SafeEntry Gateway Device (SEGW) be implemented for tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers?
    content: |
      On 4 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced that TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (TT-only SafeEntry) will be implemented at all venues that experience higher throughput of visitors, and/or where people are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods from 17 May 2021. The TT programme and SafeEntry are important digital tools that enable contact tracers to quickly identify and isolate close contacts of COVID-19 cases. This helps to break transmission chains and prevent community outbreaks. TT tokens may be collected at designated collection points (please refer to [https://token.gowhere.gov.sg](https://token.gowhere.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more information).

      Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers must therefore ensure that TT-only SafeEntry is implemented in your premises, and that entry to your centres will be allowed only if the individual uses their TT App to scan the centre’s QR code or presents the QR code on the TT token to be scanned. This includes staff, students aged 7 years and above, parents and other visitors.

      It is mandatory for all tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers to deploy SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) to facilitate SafeEntry (SE) check-in for students aged 7 years and above, parents, staff and visitors, and help users check that their TT token is working. Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers are reminded to download the SafeEntry (Business) app to use the SEGW function or register for a SEGW box on the SE website (go.gov.sg/gateway-overview). Centres should maintain attendance records for children below 7 to facilitate contact tracing if required.  

      At the point of entry into the centres, if any student forgets to bring their TT token, they should be asked to download the TT app on their phones before they are allowed entry. However, if the student is unable to do so (e.g. phone is out of battery), the student’s personal details should be noted down as a last resort, before the individual is granted entry. The centre should retain all such records for at least a month to facilitate contact tracing if necessary. 

      Business may refer to the SafeEntry User Guide for requirements on how to scan the TT tokens, available at [https://www.safeentry.gov.sg](https://www.safeentry.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}(please navigate to Resources > User Guide > SafeEntry NRIC User Guide for Business). Updates may also be found at [https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/whats-new/press-releases](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/whats-new/press-releases){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

  - title: Will private tutors providing in-person classes operating out of private residences be required to implement the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system?
    content: |
      As with tuition and enrichment centres (see Q16), private tutors providing in-person classes operating out of private residences will need to implement TT-only SafeEntry.

  - title: Can private tuition/enrichment classes and training sessions provide food and drinks to students?
    content: |
      In line with the prevailing safe management measures, food and drinks should not be provided. Students should keep their masks on at all times, and not consume any food and drinks during classes, as far as possible.

      If necessary, for exxample, during full day workshops or courses, students may bring their own packed food, and consume the food and drinks, subject to additional safe management measures.

  - title: Can private tuition/enrichment classes and training sessions involving transient mask-off activities such as food tasting be allowed to continue?
    content: |
      Students are strongly encouraged to keep their masks on throughout class as much as possible. If necessary as part of the lesson, transient mask-off activities such as food tasting are allowed, subject to additional safe management measures(please refer to Q4).

  - title: Can MOE help to facilitate a refund of the fees I had already paid for the period where face-to-face classes were suspended for students aged 18 years and younger?
    content: |
      As matters pertaining to the payment of fees is a contractual matter and practices vary across different providers, we advise parents, guardians and affected students to work with and seek an amicable resolution directly with the private provider in question.
