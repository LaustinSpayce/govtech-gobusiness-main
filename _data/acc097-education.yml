  - title: What types of classes need to be suspended, given the tighter safe distancing measures announced on 16 May 2021?
    content: |
      All organisations and individuals offering tuition and enrichment activities, whether academic or non-academic, must shift their lessons for students aged 18 and younger online from 19 May 2021 to 13 June 2021 (both dates inclusive) or otherwise suspend these lessons during this period. This includes but is not limited to education and development support activities, arts and culture classes and workshops, religious classes, as well as sports and physical activity classes and programmes. The decision to suspend these classes is due to the higher risk of transmission of COVID-19 caused by intermingling of students from different schools, and to avoid interactions between tutors and students. This is also in line with schools' move to full Home-Based Learning.

      The above applies to all organisations and individuals (including centre-based classes, home-based businesses as well as one-on-one classes), with the exception of the following, which may continue on-premise instruction, subject to prevailing safe management measures:

      a.	MOE-registered Foreign System Kindergartens;
      
      b.	Organisations providing full-time pre-tertiary education to students age 18 and below that leads to a qualification, i.e. Private Education Institutions (PEIs) registered with the Committee for Private Education and Privately-funded Schools (PFSs); Nonetheless, MOE would strongly encourage these organisations to shift lessons online<sup>1</sup>;
      
      c.	For pre-school children (aged 0-6), organisations and individuals providing learning interventions provided by therapists regulated by the Allied Health Professions Council, or Early Intervention (EI) centres funded by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA)<sup>2</sup>, in compliance with ECDA’s guidelines for EI services;
      
      d.	Organisations and individuals providing consultation and assessment services for students aged 7 to 18 with special educational needs or disabilities provided by therapists regulated by the Allied Health Professions Council or psychologists registered with the Singapore Psychological Society’s Register of Psychologists in alignment with MOH guidelines on healthcare services; and

      Early Childhood Development Centres licensed by ECDA, and student care centres may continue to provide care to children, subject to prevailing safe management measures. On-premise instruction provided in the course of this care will also be permitted.

      Classes catering exclusively to students older than 18 years old may also continue in person, subject to prevailing safe management measures.

      <sup>1</sup>i.e. Anglo-Chinese School (International), Hwa Chong International School, St Joseph’s Institution International (High School)
      <br><sup>2</sup>Businesses or individuals that provide arts and sports therapy can approach NAC or SportSG respectively to appeal to continue their services.

  - title: Will private tutors operating out of private residences be required to suspend their lessons?
    content: |
      All home-based tuition/enrichment providers must implement online classes or suspend lessons from 19 May 2021 to 13 June 2021 (inclusive), unless they cater solely to students older than age 18. The decision to suspend classes for students aged 18 and younger is due to the higher risk of transmission of COVID-19 caused by intermingling of students from different schools, and to avoid interactions between tutors and students. This is also in line with schools' move to full Home-Based Learning.

      For home-based tuition/enrichment that cater solely to students older than age 18, home ventilation should be improved by opening doors and windows. Fans can be used to promote air circulation when needed.

  - title: Will classes catering exclusively to students older than 18 years old, including Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses for adults be allowed to continue?
    content: |
      Yes, classes catering exclusively to students older than 18 years old may continue in person, subject to prevailing safe management measures.

  - title: I am an operator of a company/private school providing activities to both school-going children and adults. Is my company/ school subjected to the suspension?
    content: |
      The suspension will apply to private tuition and enrichment activities for students aged 18 and younger, to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of our students. Staff should ensure that students aged 18 and younger are not participating in any activities run by the school.  

      Classes catering exclusively to students older than age 18 will be allowed to continue, subject to prevailing safe management measures.

  - title: Why are centre-based tuition and enrichment suspended?
    content: |
      With the recent increase in number of community cases, we are stepping up precautionary measures to safeguard the well-being of all Singaporeans. The suspension of in-person tuition and enrichment classes is aimed at reducing activities where there is significant intermingling of students from different schools, since this poses a higher risk of transmission of COVID-19, and to avoid interactions between tutors and students. It is also in line with schools’ move to full Home-Based Learning. Classes can continue online where feasible.
      
  - title: What are the safe management measures that should be implemented for tuition and enrichment centres that are suspended?
    content: |
      With regard to the suspension of classes for students aged 18 and younger, tuition and enrichment centres must ensure that work-from-home is the default arrangement for employees who are able to do so. For employees who return to the workplace (e.g. to maintain critical IT functions), tuition and enrichment centres are required to abide by the nationwide safe management measures for workplaces issued on 9 May 2020. These include health checks, the use of SafeEntry to support contact tracing for all employees, wearing of masks at all times and regular cleaning of common facilities and high-touch areas. Details are available at the GoBusiness website.

  - title: What centres are allowed to continue on-premise instruction, and what are the safe management measures that they should implement?
    content: |
      Details on the centres that are allowed to continue on-premise instruction can be found above.

      To reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19, centres are required to abide by the nationwide safe management measures for workplaces issued on 9 May 2020. These include health checks, the use of SafeEntry to support contact tracing for all employees, students and other visitors, wearing of masks at all times, and regular cleaning of common facilities and high-touch areas. More details are available at the GoBusiness website.

      For employees, tuition and enrichment centres must ensure that work-from-home is the default arrangement for employees who are able to do so. 

      For students, centres which are allowed to continue on-premise instruction are encouraged to consider online lessons as the default arrangement. In the event that face-to-face classes continue, they are expected to observe all the following measures in classrooms and other areas accessed by students:

      a. **Safe distancing.** Safe distancing measures for centres which are allowed to continue on-premise instruction are:

        i.	<u>Students</u>: Centres must ensure safe distancing between students by putting up appropriate floor demarcations and/or physical barriers, e.g. using safety tape. There must also be strict separation between students in different classrooms at all times, with no intermingling.
        <br>I.	As a default, centres must ensure that all students maintain safe distancing of at least 1m at all times, with strictly no physical interaction between students. 
        <br>II.	If it is not possible to apply 1m safe distancing between students and some interaction is unavoidable, centres may instead organise students into groups of no more than two students, with strictly no physical interaction or intermingling between different groups. Centres must strictly maintain a minimum of 1m spacing between pairs, although MOE advises 2m spacing between pairs as a best practice.

        ii.	<u>Tutors/instructors</u>: They are allowed to move between pairs. However, contact should be transient, and they should remain at the front of the class as much as is practicable.

        iii. <u>Capacity</u>: No single room within a centre should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors, even as the above measures are adopted.

        iv.	Centres are also reminded that per MOM’s guidelines for workplaces, there should be no cross-deployment across worksites. More information on prevailing workplace SMMs can be found on the [MOM website](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}.

      b. **Health declarations.** Centres should not permit students who are placed on Leave of Absence (LOA) or Approved Absence (AA) by their schools, or students who are on a Stay Home Notice (SHN), or Home Quarantine Order (HQO) to attend lessons. We also advise centres to watch out for students with fever or respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, breathlessness, runny nose, loss of sense of smell, cough, or sore throat. Students with the above symptoms or who are unwell should be sent home immediately, and should not be allowed to attend lessons. As a best practice, centres should also check if a family member living in the same household is unwell. If so, the child should not attend lessons in person.

      c. **Disinfection of surfaces.** All surfaces in classrooms must be thoroughly disinfected between classes. Sharing of all equipment (e.g. props, microphones) should be avoided as far as possible. If this cannot be done, the equipment should be thoroughly cleaned and/or disinfected before being handled or used by others. Please note that sharing of wind/brass instruments or parts thereof (e.g. mouthpieces, reeds) is not allowed  (please refer to the next question for details; note that all in-person singing, and wind/brass instrument classes are suspended during Phase Two (Heightened Alert)).

      d. **Masks must be worn as a default at all times,** except for persons allowed to use face shields instead of masks (e.g. persons with health conditions resulting in breathing/medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period). Instructors are expected to wear a surgical mask or reusable masks of equivalent effectiveness at all times.

      e. **Class timings.** Centres must allocate at least 15 minutes between classes. This is to allow adequate time to disinfect classroom surfaces, and to ensure strict separation of individuals from different classes. Centres should also work out attendance and dismissal arrangements that help avoid congestion of individuals in or outside the centre. 

      f. **Ventilation.** All premises should abide by the latest guidance on improving ventilation and indoor air quality in buildings amid the COVID-19 situation, available on the [NEA website](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/advisories/guidance-on-improving-ventilation-and-indoor-air-quality-in-buildings-amid-the-covid-19-situation){:target="_blank"}.

      Centres should also abide by other sector-specific Safe Management Measures available on the GoBusiness website, and to prevailing circulars issued by the Government.

  - title: Some tuition and enrichment classes involve high movement activities (e.g. sports, dance), or activities which carry a higher risk of virus transmission through droplet spread (e.g. singing, wind/brass instruments). What additional safe management measures should be implemented?
    content: |
      <u>Sports Classes</u>

      <u>For students aged 18 and younger</u>

      As they are of higher risk, sport or physical activity classes for students aged 18 and younger may only continue outdoors, with a maximum of one instructor and one student at all times. If the activity is strenuous, masks can be taken off but have to be put on immediately after the end of the activity. 

      For students aged 18 and younger, all indoor physical activity and sport classes, as well as outdoor physical activity and sport classes involving more than one student, are to be suspended from 19 May 2021 to 13 June 2021 (both dates inclusive). 

      Further guidance is set out in the safe management measures outlined by Sport Singapore.

      <u>For students aged above 18</u>

      Higher-risk facilities, such as indoor gyms and fitness/dance/exercise studios must be closed between 16 May 2021 and 13 Jun 2021 (dates inclusive), unless they only offer low intensity physical activities, sport and exercises, where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times, subject to capacity limits (no single room should hold more than 30 persons, including tutors/instructors). Outdoor exercise classes may continue. For detailed guidance, please refer to the advisory issued by Sport Singapore.

      <u>Dance Classes</u>

      No classes may take place for students aged 18 and younger from 19 May 2021 to 13 Jun 2021 (both dates inclusive). For classes exclusively for students older than age 18, the following additional safe management measures apply:

      Indoor dance classes may only proceed if they are able to adhere to additional safe management measures (including all participants and instructors wearing masks at all times, and further capacity limits; no single room should hold more than 30 persons, including tutors/instructors), as detailed in the advisory issued by the [National Arts Council](https://www.nac.gov.sg/whatwedo/support/sustaining-the-arts-during-covid-19/Safe-Management-Measures-for-the-Arts-and-Culture-Sector-.html){:target="_blank"}. Outdoor dance classes must comply with the measures in the advisory issued by issued by Sport Singapore. 

      <u>Singing, Wind/Brass Instrument Classes</u>

      As in-person singing and wind/brass instrument classes involve a higher risk of virus transmission due to voice projection or intentional expulsion of air, they are to be suspended from 16 May to 13 Jun 2021 (dates inclusive).

      <u>Voice Training, Speech and Drama Classes</u>

      No classes may take place for students aged 18 and younger from 19 May 2021 to 13 Jun 2021 (both dates inclusive). For classes exclusively for students older than age 18, the following additional safe management measures apply:

      Voice training and speech and drama classes may continue, with all participants and instructors wearing masks at all times, subject to additional safe management measures and capacity limits (no single room should hold more than 30 persons, including tutors/instructors) as detailed in the advisory issued by the [National Arts Council](https://www.nac.gov.sg/whatwedo/support/sustaining-the-arts-during-covid-19/Safe-Management-Measures-for-the-Arts-and-Culture-Sector-.html){:target="_blank"}. 

  - title: What centres are allowed to continue on-premise instruction, and what are the safe management measures that they should implement?
    content: |
      No. Only one-on-one classes involving sport or physical activity may continue, subject to the safe management measures outlined by SportSG.

  - title: Are private schools, including tuition and enrichment centres, allowed to hold year-end concerts or performances on their premises?
    content: |
      All indoor live performances scheduled to take place from 16 May to 13 June 2021 (dates inclusive) are to be deferred/postponed to reduce the risk of transmission.

  - title: Will Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses for adults be allowed to continue?
    content: |
      Yes, in-person training can continue for all CET activities at the Institutes of Higher Learning and by SSG-funded training providers. Notwithstanding this, online learning should be supported where feasible. 

      For health and safety reasons, the maximum class size for all CET activities is capped at 50 persons (including the trainer(s)). For SSG-funded CET programmes, SSG’s prevailing guideline for a maximum class size of 40 persons (excluding the trainer(s)) for course quality reasons remains and takes precedence. 

      As far as possible, training providers should ensure safe distancing of at least 1m between individuals at all times. Where not feasible or practical to do so, this 1m requirement can instead be enforced between groups, with each group made up of not more than **two** persons with effect from 16 May, and no mixing between different groups. There should be assigned seating in classrooms and other training venues where practicable.

  - title: Will private tuition/enrichment classes and training sessions held in external venues (e.g. function rooms) be allowed to continue for students older than age 18?
    content: |
      MOE strongly recommends that telecommuting and online lessons be the default arrangement, to reduce physical contact between individuals. Notwithstanding this, private tuition/enrichment classes, and training sessions by the Institutes of Higher Learning and SSG-funded training providers, conducted at external venues can continue, if those venues are open. Such external venues may include condominium function rooms, private conference and meeting rooms, etc. 

      However, conduct of face-to-face lessons is subject to premise capacity caps and safe management measures. Private providers should approach premise owners for advice on the capacity caps for their respective venues. No single room should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors/trainers, subject to further capacity limits for masked sports/dance/speech/voice training/drama classes, or the premise capacity cap, whichever is lower. 

      There should be a wipe-down regimen after each use at such external venues. Private providers must also adhere to the safe management guidelines for private tuition/enrichment and CET courses, which are outlined in the FAQs within this section. 

  - title: Can tuition and enrichment centres providing face-to-face classes for students older than age 18 switch to online learning?
    content: |
      Yes, tuition and enrichment centres providing face-to-face classes are strongly encouraged to consider online lessons as the default arrangement during this period of heightened risk. Centres should review the safe management measures that they are able to put in place and can make their own business decisions regarding continuation of online learning, taking into consideration the efficacy of instruction and the needs and expectations of students/parents.

  - title: Can employees of private tuition and enrichment centres continue to work, even if centres have switched to online learning?
    content: |
      Tuition and enrichment centres are required to abide by the nationwide [safe management measures for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}. Tele-conferencing should be used in place of in-person meetings as far as possible. Where employees can perform their work by telecommuting from home, employers must ensure that they do so.

  - title: I am a private provider / Allied Health Professional offering services for students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) or disabilities. May I provide services and what are the safe management measures that I need to adhere to?
    content: |
      Registered Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) defined as professionals regulated by the Allied Health Professions Council and psychologists registered with the Singapore Psychological Society’s Register of Psychologists can continue to provide consultation and assessment services for students (aged 7-18) with special educational needs or disabilities.  These AHPs should adhere to sector-specific guidelines, prevailing precautionary measures and safe distancing requirements, as well as infection and control measures such as hand hygiene and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) guidelines relevant to each setting.   Please refer to ECDA’s guidelines on Early Intervention (EI) services for pre-school children (aged 0-6).

      All non-Public Healthcare Institutions AHS, including psychology services, must adhere to the following:

      a. Group therapy for a maximum of 2 clients per session (count excludes AHPs and support staff)

      For other face-to-face services for students with SEN or disabilities, MOE requires that all organisations and individuals offering tuition and enrichment activities must shift their lessons for students aged 18 and younger online from 19 May 2021 to 13 June 2021 (both dates inclusive) or otherwise suspend these lessons during this period.

      The following are exceptions which may continue on-premise instruction, subject to prevailing safe management measures:

      a.	For pre-school children (aged 0-6), organisations and individuals providing learning interventions provided by therapists regulated by the Allied Health Professions Council, or Early Intervention (EI) services funded by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), in compliance with ECDA’s guidelines for EI services; and

      b.	Organisations and individuals providing consultation and assessment services for students aged 7 to 18 with special educational needs or disabilities provided by therapists regulated by the Allied Health Professions Council or psychologists registered with the Singapore Psychological Society’s Register of Psychologists in alignment with MOH guidelines on healthcare services.

  - title: Will the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system and the SafeEntry Gateway Device (SEGW) be implemented for tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers?
    content: |
      On 4 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced that TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (TT-only SafeEntry) will be implemented at all venues that experience higher throughput of visitors, and/or where people are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods from 17 May 2021. The TT programme and SafeEntry are important digital tools that enable contact tracers to quickly identify and isolate close contacts of COVID-19 cases. This helps to break transmission chains and prevent community outbreaks. TT tokens may be collected at designated collection points (please refer to [https://token.gowhere.gov.sg](https://token.gowhere.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} for more information).

      Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers must therefore ensure that TT-only SafeEntry is implemented in your premises from 17 May 2021, and that entry to your centres will be allowed only if the individual uses their TT App to scan the centre’s QR code or presents the QR code on the TT token to be scanned. This includes staff, students aged 7 years and above, parents and other visitors.

      From 15 June 2021, it is mandatory for all tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers to deploy SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) to facilitate SafeEntry (SE) check-in for students aged 7 years and above, parents, staff and visitors, and help users check that their TT token is working. Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers are reminded to download the SafeEntry (Business) app to use the SEGW function or register for a SEGW box on the SE website ([go.gov.sg/gateway-overview](https://go.gov.sg/gateway-overview){:target="_blank"}). Centres should maintain attendance records for children below 7 to facilitate contact tracing if required.  

      At the point of entry into the centres, if any student forgets to bring their TT token, they should be asked to download the TT app on their phones before they are allowed entry. Individuals will only be granted entry with IDs as a last resort. 

      Business may refer to the SafeEntry User Guide for requirements on how to scan the TT tokens, available at [https://www.safeentry.gov.sg](https://www.safeentry.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} (please navigate to Resources > User Guide > SafeEntry NRIC User Guide for Business). Updates may also be found at [https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/whats-new/press-releases](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/whats-new/press-releases){:target="_blank"}.

  - title: Will private tutors providing face-to-face classes for students older than age 18 operating out of private residences be required to implement the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system?
    content: |
      As with tuition and enrichment centres, private tutors providing face-to-face classes for students older than age 18 operating out of private residences will need to implement TT-only SafeEntry.

  - title: Can MOE help to facilitate a refund of the fees I had already paid when face-to-face classes were suspended for students aged 18 years and younger?
    content: |
      As matters pertaining to the payment of fees is a contractual matter and practices vary across different providers, we advise parents, guardians and affected students to work with and seek an amicable resolution directly with the private provider in question.

  - title: When will the suspension on face-to-face tuition and enrichment classes for students aged 18 and younger be lifted?
    content: |
      We expect these measures to be in place until 13 Jun 2021, but the Multi-Ministry Task Force will review the circumstances and may extend the suspension if necessary.

  - title: Which students are considered “above 18” and not subject to the suspension of private tuition and enrichment?
    content: |
      This refers to students who have passed their 18th birthday. However, with the recent numbers of community cases, we strongly encourage all organisations and individuals offering tuition and enrichment activities to older students to similarly move online or suspend in-person instruction as well. This would support efforts to keep our students and the community safe.
