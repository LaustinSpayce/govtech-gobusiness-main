      content: |
        For applications with ‘Permitted’ status, ‘N/A’ will be reflected under the ‘No. of manpower onsite’, since manpower declaration will no longer be required for ‘Permitted applications from 5 Apr 2021. 

        For applications with ‘Approved’ status, the employment records are accurate as at Dec 2020. We allow for reasonable fluctuations to this number. Therefore, you should continue to declare your manpower details.

        However, should the numbers vary substantially, you should submit a copy of your manpower records with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and/or the Central Provident Fund (CPF) to MTI at <covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg>{:target="_blank"}.

    - title: I need to update the Ministry of Manpower of changes in my foreign workers’ particulars (e.g. residential address) during their employment. Where can I find more information about this?

    - title: I have problems adding in more manpower details to my application. Why is it so?
      content: |
        Depending on the status & conditions tagged to your exemption, each application is allotted a specific manpower quota. You will not be able to add more employees to your application once you have reached the allotted quota.  The cap on the number of employees that you are allowed to have on-site is necessary to minimise the movement of workers to and from work.  We are aware that this will be disruptive for businesses, but it is also essential in the fight against COVID-19.

    - title: I need more manpower on site to ensure the continuation of my business activities. What should I do?

This submission of manpower details is required to facilitate information updates for the AccessCode on the SGWorkPass app, including the approval to work and the requirement for regular swabbing. Failure to do so will cause the employee’s SGWorkPass AccessCode status to reflect as “Red”.

    - title: What manpower details must I submit, and from when should I be submitting?
      content: |
        You will need to submit the FIN/NRICs of your workers/employees that are working on-site, and the maximum number of workers on site at any given time. If your workers are working on-site, you will also need to provide the address of the work premises, and indicate whether the work premises is a production site (e.g. shipyards/ production plant) or non-production site (e.g. other workplaces/ office premise). Please note that workers deployed at production sites will be required to undergo **Rostered Routine Testing (RRT)**.

        For workers and employees that are working from home, who subsequently need to go back to site for specific reasons, you will need to submit their FIN details. 

        Only the details for Singapore Citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents, Employment Pass Holders, S Pass Holders and Work Permit Holders are required to be submitted. All other non-MOM work pass holders (e.g long-term visitor pass or ICA work pass) need not be submitted.

    - title: What is considered a production site?
      content: |
        Production site is defined as areas where shipbuilding/ship repair, process maintenance and construction activities are carried out. Examples of production sites includes shipyards, process plants, refineries and fabrication workshops.

    - title: If my office is located within my production site, how should I indicate so in my manpower submission?
      content: |
        If the office staff do not come into contact with the production site workers and are clearly segregated, you can indicate your premises as a non-production site.

    - title: If my worker/employees are deployed across multiple sites, how do I indicate so when submitting my manpower details?
      content: |
        You will need to click on the “Add Premises” button to key in the details of your workers/employees that are deployed across multiple sites.

    - title: Will I receive any additional notification to know whether my worker/employee is approved to work on-site? How do I know if my submitted manpower is approved to work on-site?
      content: |
        Upon submission of the manpower details, you will receive an email acknowledgement. The AccessCode on SGWorkPass app will determine whether your submitted manpower is allowed to work on site. The AccessCode will factor in a few parameters, namely:

        - Worker’s health status 

        - Worker’s place of residence is COVID-free

        - Worker’s approval to work

    - title: By when should I submit my manpower details to know whether my worker/employee will be allowed to work on-site?
      content: |
        You will need to submit your manpower details by 1730 hours, for your worker/employees’ AccessCode to be updated by 2359 hours on the following day via the SGWorkPass app.

    - title: What happens if the employee/workers’ AccessCode is not updated?

    - title: When do I need to update my manpower details submission?
      content: |
        You will need to update your manpower details as soon as there is a change in the specific workers required to work on-site, as this will affect arrangements for your workers’ regular swab tests.

    - title: My SSIC code is in Marine/Offshore/Process but that is not the nature of my work. Do I still have to submit my manpower details?

These details are required to ensure that your workers’ SG WorkPass app AccessCode reflects their approval to be deployed for work and to facilitate arrangement for regular swab tests.

    - title: I have successfully submitted my manpower details but the Workpass app still comes out as red. Can I proceed to deploy my workers?
