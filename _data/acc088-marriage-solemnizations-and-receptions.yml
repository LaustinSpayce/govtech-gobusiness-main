    - title: 1. What are the latest requirements for marriage solemnisations and wedding receptions?
      content: |
        As we resume normalcy in our daily activities, the Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) was lifted fully from 10 October 2022. This means that VDS is no longer required for events with more than 500 participants and dining in at F&B establishments at any one time. For solemnisations and wedding receptions, VDS is no longer needed, regardless of the size of the solemnisation or reception. 

        Mask-wearing is generally optional for both indoor and outdoor settings. Individuals can continue to wear their masks for personal protection and to protect others, especially in crowded areas. However, mask-wearing is required on public transport as well as indoor healthcare and residential care home settings. 

        We would like to remind everyone to continue to exercise personal and social responsibility through maintaining hygiene, testing and minimizing social interactions when unwell, and keeping up-to-date with [vaccinations](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Should there be further tightening, couples should be prepared to adjust their plans accordingly.

        Please refer to the [MTF press release dated 7 October 2022](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/vaccination-our-primary-defence-in-living-with-covid-19){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for further details.

        However, venue operators have the flexibility to implement conditions of service that are relevant to their settings, such as requiring the donning of masks, as well as adopting specific instructions for patrons or workers who remain unvaccinated. Couples should check with venue operators for their requirements.
