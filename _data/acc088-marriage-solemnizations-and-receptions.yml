    - title: What are the latest requirements for marriage solemnisations and wedding receptions?
      content: |
        The updated safe management measures (SMMs) for marriage solemnisations and wedding receptions are as follows:  

        ||**From 29 March 2022 onwards**|
        |**Marriage Solemnisations**||
        |Home|Up to 10 visitors, with Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs (VDS) requirement<sup>1</sup>|
        |ROM/M Building|Up to 16 attendees, with VDS requirement|
        |External venues| <u>For indoor settings:</u><br>* If no food and beverage (F&B) is served, this will be a mask-on event, and will be subjected to the venue capacity.  However, if there are more than 1,000 attendees, it will be subject to 75% of venue capacity<sup>2</sup>.<br>* If F&B is served, this will be a mask-off event, similar to wedding receptions. Event size will be subject to venue capacity limit allowing safe distancing requirements to be met. Group size of up to 10 attendees and 1 metre safe distance between groups apply.<br><br><u>For outdoor settings:</u><br>* No limit on event size; subject to venue capacity limit allowing safe distancing requirements to be met.<br>* As mask wearing is optional for outdoor setting, group size of up to 10 attendees and 1 metre safe distance between groups apply if attendees are mask-off.<br><br>With VDS requirement.|
        |**Wedding Receptions**||
        |ROM/M Building|Not allowed|
        |Home|Up to 10 visitors at any one time (including vendors)|
        |External venues| * •	No limit on event size; subject to venue capacity limit allowing safe distancing requirements to be met. Group size of up to 10 attendees and 1 metre safe distance between groups apply.<br>* With VDS requirement.|

        These limits include the couple, but exclude the Licensed Solemniser and any other vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the wedding event, unless otherwise stated. The couples and all attendees (including the Licensed Solemniser and vendors) will have to abide by VDS entry requirements.

        Please refer to the wedding-related requirements [here](/safemanagement/sector/). 

        Organisers must ensure that before entering the event, all attendees must check in to the event using TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, unless the event venue is already subject to SafeEntry and VDS checks separately. TraceTogether, the SEBizApp or HealthHub can be used to check the vaccination status of attendees.  The venue owner/operator or organisers should have a unique QR code for the event space, e.g. hotel ballroom or private room in a restaurant.

        For home solemnisations, organisers are required to remind all attendees at least one hour before the start of the event that VDS applies to the event.

        For more information on SafeEntry, please refer to the link [here](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/safeentry/).

        For more information on VDS, please refer to MOH's advisory at [https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo](https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}

        <sup>1</sup> Where VDS is required, it means that checks must be implemented to ensure that every attendee<br> 
        a) is fully vaccinated i.e. has received the appropriate regimen of World Health Organisation Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines including their respective duration post-vaccination for the vaccine to be fully effective, and had their vaccination records ingested in MOH’s national IT systems. From 14 February 2022, persons aged 18 years old and above who have completed the primary vaccination series and are eligible for booster vaccination will be considered as fully vaccinated for 270 days after the last dose in their primary vaccination series. Upon receiving their booster, they will continue to be considered as fully vaccinated beyond the 270 days. The same will apply to persons aged 12 to 17 years old from 14 March 2022; or<br>
        b) has recovered from COVID-19 in Singapore with unvaccinated or incomplete vaccination status within 180 days starting from the day of first local positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result, or positive  Antigen Rapid Test (ART) result obtained at approved test providers (including self-administered ART and supervised self-administered ART) or positive serology test result attributable to infection and not past vaccination; or<br>
        c) is a child aged 12 years or below; or<br>
        d) is certified as medically ineligible for all vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme (NVP). To be certified as medically ineligible, individuals may visit a doctor familiar with their medical condition, or alternatively, any clinic or hospital.<br>

        <sup>2</sup> For example, if an event venue’s full capacity is 2,000 attendees (after compliance with fire safety requirement), the venue can take in solemnisation of up to 1,500 attendees based on the 75% capacity limit. Venue operators should spread out the attendees evenly within the venue, to reduce crowding.

    - title: Why are measures changed so often?
      content: |
        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation, and will continue to review the safe management measures and community related activities. However, should there be further tightening, couples should be prepared to adjust their plans accordingly.

      content: |
        Please refer to sector-specific requirements for marriage solemnizations [here](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

    - title: Are vendors (e.g. photographers, videographers) part of the attendee limit?
      content: |
        Vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the marriage solemnisation or wedding reception are excluded from the attendance limit for these events. (Vendors who are also invited guests are part of the attendee limit).

    - title: Can the bride and groom remove face masks for the solemnisation ceremony or wedding reception? Can the bride and groom use face shields in place of face masks? Can the rest of the attendees be unmasked for photo-taking?
      content: |
        As a special provision, the bride and groom may be unmasked throughout the marriage solemnisation (excluding ROM/M Building) or wedding reception event. To enjoy the unmasking provision, the wedding couple is required to (i) undergo an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) minimally supervised by the venue operator<sup>3</sup> (either in person or virtually); or (ii) have a valid Pre-Event Test (PET) within 24 hours prior to the end of the event. The bride and groom must maintain a 1-metre distance from the rest of the attendees of the marriage solemnisation or wedding reception (with the exception of the attendees in the same group as the bride and groom) whenever masks and face shields are removed.

        Should the bride and groom opt not to undergo the ART or PET, they may remove their face shields or mask for key moments only (e.g. when exchanging vows for rings, kiss, march-in/outs) and maintain a safe distance of at least 1 metre from others at such times.

        Mask-wearing continues to be required for indoor settings but is optional in outdoor settings. However, we encourage individuals to wear their masks even when outdoors for personal protection and to protect others, especially in crowded areas<sup>4</sup>.  Masks may be removed momentarily for photo-taking and must be worn immediately after.

        Should there be any attendee with legitimate reasons to unmask (e.g. under the special provisions), organiser must ensure that safe distance of at least 1 metre is being adhered to between the unmasked attendee and the other attendees.

        On the use of masks and face shield, please refer to the latest guidelines [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/general/faqs---masks-and-personal-protective-equipment-(ppe)#:~:text=A%3A,of%20transmission%20of%20COVID%2D19){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

        <sup>3</sup> Venue operator refers to the party that has charge, management or control of the room or place where the event takes place, during the period of the event.
        <sup>4</sup> Children aged twelve years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time, may wear a face shield as indicated in MOM's Advisory of 1 Jun 2020 (“Guidance for Use of Masks and Face Shields”)

    - title: As a wedding couple, I would like to be unmasked for my solemnisation / reception, but my venue operator is not available to supervise my ART. What can I do?
      content: |
        If you are unable to do an ART minimally supervised by the venue operator (either in person or virtually), you can opt to have a valid PET obtained within 24 hours prior to the end of the event. Otherwise, the wedding couples can choose to wear a face shield instead of a face mask, and to remove the face shield for the key moments (e.g. when exchanging vows for rings, kiss, march-in/outs). 

    - title: Are pre-wedding photo shoots allowed to take place? Can face masks/ shields be removed for pre-wedding photo shoots?
      content: |
        Pre-wedding photo shoots must adhere to IMDA's Mandatory Safety Rules for the Resumption of Content Production. Please check directly with the wedding photographer on the Safe Management Measures that must be adhered to.

    - title: What are the guidelines for the attendance limit of home solemnisations, if I have more than 10 residents in my household?
      content: |
        For marriage solemnisations held in a place of residence, the maximum number of attendees for the home solemnisation must not exceed 10 visitors. This limit includes the couple, but excludes the Licensed Solemniser and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnisation. Please note that from 1 February 2022, VDS requirement has been implemented for home solemnisations. 

        For example, if there are 6 residents currently living in your household, the 6 residents and an additional 10 visitors can attend a solemnisation in your home. The total of 16 attendees includes the wedding couple but excludes the Solemniser and vendors. Or if you live alone, you and 10 other attendees, including the wedding couple, can attend a solemnisation in your home, excluding the Solemniser and vendors.

        Organisers should ensure that residents who are not attendees of the home solemnisation do not physically interact or intermingle with the attendees at the solemnisation.

        For the safety of all who are attending your home solemnisation, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

        - The bride and groom may be unmasked throughout the home solemnisation. The wedding couples are required to (i) undergo an ART minimally supervised by the venue operator (either in person or virtually); or (ii) have a valid PET within 24 hours prior to the end of the event. The bride and groom may opt out from the ART or PET and remove their face shields/masks for key moments such as to exchange vows, rings, to kiss and during march-ins/ outs. Other guests must maintain a 1-metre distance from the bride and groom when they are unmasked. 

        - All guests must wear masks for the duration of the solemnisation. They may remove their masks momentarily for photo-taking and must wear their masks immediately after the photos are taken.

    - title: If we opt for solemnisation via video link, what is the limit to the number of guests in the same venue? Can the bride, groom, witnesses and guests be in the same venue?
      content: |
        For solemnisations via video-link, the prevailing home visit guidelines should be adhered to (i.e. up to 10 visitors to a home at any one time). The bride, groom, witnesses, and guests can be in the same location if they belong to the same household or if they are within the prevailing home visit guidelines (i.e. up to 10 visitors to a home at any one time). Other guests exceeding the 10 visitors allowed may wish to join in through video-link instead. Such processes through video-link ensures marriage solemnisations take place in a safe manner.
