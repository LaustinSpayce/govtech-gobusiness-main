    - title: Why are measures changed so often?
      content: |
        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation, and will continue to review the safe management measures and community related activities. However, should there be further tightening, couples should be prepared to adjust their plans accordingly.

        Please refer to [sector-specific requirements for marriage solemnizations](/safemanagement/sector/).

    - title: 4.	My marriage solemnisation/wedding reception is held in a food and beverage (F&B) establishments and with (i) up to 500 attendees, or (ii) more than 500 attendees. Will VDS, including having TraceTogether and SafeEntry checks be required for my event?
      content: |
        (i)	Where the wedding event is held at F&B establishments with up to 500 attendees, VDS is required for attendees, i.e. guests and parties to the marriage. However, F&B establishments will no longer need to conduct VDS entry checks for their customers. Couples and organisers should advise the attendees that VDS is required, and the onus will be on the attendees to abide by the rules.

        (ii)	Where the wedding event is held at F&B establishments with more than 500 attendees, the organisers have to conduct VDS entry checks for all the attendees, to ensure that all the attendees are fully vaccinated. 

        Please refer to the [MOH info sheet on VDS](https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for the most updated information on the VDS, vaccination regimens and approved vaccines recognized for eligibility for VDS
