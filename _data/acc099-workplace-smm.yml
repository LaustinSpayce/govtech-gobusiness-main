    - title: Are there specific Safe Management Measures for each sector (e.g. F&B, retail)?
      content: |
        The requirements on Safe Management Measures at the workplace released by MOM is for general workplace settings. For specific workplace settings or sector requirements, please refer to [guidelines issued by the respective sector agencies](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector).

    - title: We have received two advisories, one from MOM and another from the sector agency. Which one do we follow?
      content: |
        The advisory on Safe Management Measures and the accompanying checklist issued by MOM are for general workplace settings. Where there may be sector-specific considerations, companies should also refer to the sector-specific advisories issued, over and above MOM's advisory.

    - title: My employees do not have a specific workplace as they are deployed to client's site to provide goods and services. How can I implement Safe Management Measures?
      content: |
        All employers must implement Safe Management Measures at their workplaces for all employees and contractors. 

        Companies that have employees deployed to other sites should ensure that their employees comply with the Safe Management Measures put in place at these sites. In fact, some of the Safe Management Measures can be implemented by employers regardless of where employees are deployed, such as health monitoring.

    - title: What should I do if my employer refuses to implement Safe Management Measures in the workplace?
      content: |
        If you notice any breach of Safe Management Measures or poor practices at the workplace, you can [report it to MOM](https://www.mom.gov.sg/report-WSH-issues){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

        MOM will treat each report seriously and will keep your identity strictly confidential.

    - title: Can my employers continue to dine in staff canteens?

  data:
    - title: Should my employees be masked at all times? What if my worker has medical condition?
      content: |
        Every individual should put on a mask at all times when indoors, except when:

        a) not interacting in person with another individual present in that area and employees are not in customer-facing areas where interaction is likely to happen; 
        
        b) eating, drinking or consuming medication; 
        
        c) engaging in strenuous physical exercise; or
        
        d) other equipment must be worn during the course of work (e.g. motorcycle helmets). 
        
        However, if the individual has severe medical conditions, he may wear a face shield in lieu of a mask.
        
        Mask wearing in outdoor settings, e.g. worksites that are not sheltered is optional.

    - title: Are there any available resources to help my business review work processes to enable employees to work-from-home?
      content: |
        Yes, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) provides a list of [digital solutions and resources](https://www.imda.gov.sg/bizgodigital){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} that aims to make business continuity essential more accessible to businesses.

        Eligible businesses can also apply for the [Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG)](https://www.businessgrants.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to support business transformation and put in place flexible work arrangements to minimise spread of COVID-19 (e.g. work-from-home, staggered hours).

    - title: Are employees and visitors required to wear a mask at all times at the workplace?
      content: |
        For general office workplaces that are indoors, employers must ensure that employees and visitors wear a mask at all times at the workplace, except when:
        
        a) not interacting in person with another individual present in that area and employees are not in customer-facing areas where interaction is likely to happen; 
        
        b) eating, drinking or consuming medication; 
        
        c) engaging in strenuous physical exercise; or
        
        d) other equipment must be worn during the course of work (e.g. motorcycle helmets). 
        
        Notwithstanding the above, employees are encouraged to exercise social responsibility and maintain an appropriate safe distance from others when unmasking.
        
        Mask-wearing in outdoor setting, e.g. worksites that are not sheltered is optional. 

    - title: What are considered physical interactions settings that still require individuals to put on masks?
      content: |
        Settings with physical interactions may include meetings where participants are engaged in conversations. 

    - title: Can employees seated apart at meetings be unmasked?
      content: |
        No. Employees are likely to be engaged in conversations during meetings. Therefore, they are likely to be interacting in person with another individual, even though they may be seated apart. Hence, they are required to wear mask.

    - title: Do my employees have to wear a mask when they are not attending to customers in customer-facing areas in the workplace?
      content: |
        Yes. Employees have to wear a mask in customer-facing areas as these are areas where interaction is likely to happen. Beyond the operating hours when customers are not expected to enter the area, mask wearing can be made optional. 
      
        Some examples of customer-facing areas include reception area, showrooms, building lobby, etc. 

    - title: Can employers impose mask-wearing rules beyond prevailing requirements in their workplaces?
      content: |
        Yes. Employers can impose mask-wearing rules above and beyond existing requirements with consideration to workplace safety and health and operational needs.

        Conversely, employees may also choose to continue wearing masks if they prefer or feel uncomfortable being unmasked while working indoors.

    - title: What forms of personal protective equipment should my employees use? Can employees wear other forms of PPEs (e.g. face shields) instead of surgical masks?
      content: |
        A mask that closely and completely covers the nose and mouth (i.e. without leaving a gap between the mask and the face) should be worn in indoor settings while at the workplace, except when:

        a) not interacting in person with another individual present in that area and employees are not in customer-facing areas where interaction is likely to happen; 
        
        b) eating, drinking or consuming medication; 
        
        c) engaging in strenuous physical exercise; or
        
        d) other equipment must be worn during the course of work (e.g. motorcycle helmets). 
        
        The following specific groups of persons may use a face shield, in place of masks:
        
        1. Children 12 years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time; 
        
        2. Persons who have health conditions that may result in breathing or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period of time; and
        
        3. Persons who are speaking to a group in a classroom or lecture-style setting, where they largely remain at the spot from which they are speaking, and are able to maintain a safe distance away from any other persons. 

        A face shield has to be must be worn properly so that it covers the entire face, from the forehead to below the chin, wrapping around the sides of the face.
        
        Plastic spit guards predominantly cover the mouth and are not considered as masks. Face coverings such as neck gaiters, bandannas, scarves or handkerchiefs are not considered as masks.
        
        If the risk of encountering an infectious person is high (e.g. personnel has sustained contact with many other individuals throughout the course of their work), then surgical masks and other relevant PPEs should be used instead.

    - title: Can my employees use employer-provided recreational facilities which are not located at the workplace?
      content: |
        Access to standalone recreational facilities which are located away from employees’ workplaces will depend on the re-opening plans for relevant permitted enterprises. These facilities will also be subject to stricter safe management measures. When visiting such facilities, employees will still have to comply with the relevant safe management measures in place for that setting.

    - title: Can I be unmasked while giving a speech during a work-related event?
      content: |
        Yes. You must deliver the speech from a fixed position that is at least 1 metre away from the audience.

    - title: What settings are considered indoors?
      content: |
        All buildings and places with clearly defined entrances/exits are considered indoor places (e.g. office building). Areas with open access are generally considered outdoors (e.g. office courtyard). 

        Mask-wearing is required in indoor settings, and optional in outdoor settings.

  data:
    - title: What constitutes as ‘authorised visitors' allowed to visit the workplace?
      content: |
        This refers to visitors who are visiting the workplace for official reasons, including but not limited to:

        - Suppliers or contractors who need to be physically onsite to deliver their goods and services
        - Buyers who are onsite to collect their goods and services
        - Visitors who need to attend a physical meeting within the workplace premises

        This excludes visitors who may visit the workplace for leisure purposes.

    - title: Can I use an alternative visitor management system instead of SafeEntry?
      content: |
        Businesses must use Trace-Together-only SafeEntry to collect entry information of all employees and visitors on their premises. Businesses that need to use their current systems to collect additional data, e.g. employees' ID, must ensure Trace-Together-only SafeEntry is implemented on top of their existing systems. 

    - title: Trace-Together-only SafeEntry is already implemented for my building (e.g. malls), do tenants within the building have to implement it as well?
      content: |
        As part of safe workplace measures, all venues and facilities found listed on [https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/deployment](https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/deployment){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} will have to implement Trace-Together-only SafeEntry for employees and visitors. 

        This includes office tenants/workplaces where there is a Trace-Together-only SafeEntry checkpoint at the main building entrance. 

        Please go to [https://www.support.safeentry.gov.sg/hc/en-us](https://www.support.safeentry.gov.sg/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details.

    - title: In an office setting, would leaving an empty desk marked (e.g. with a cross) suffice for safe distancing? For barriers between workstations, are there guidelines for how high they need to be?
      content: |
        Employers must ensure clear physical spacing of at least 1m between persons at all times and demarcate safe physical distances (at least 1m apart) with visual indicators or physical means such as barriers between work stations. If leaving an empty desk and demarcating clearly with visual indicators allows for at least 1m distancing between employees, such an approach can be considered. For barriers between workstations, while there are no specific height guidelines, the barriers should also facilitate the required safe physical distance of 1m apart.

    - title: How frequently should I clean my workplace, i.e. what is considered regular cleaning?
      content: |
        As the recommended frequency and intensity may differ by sector, businesses should refer to the sanitation and hygiene advisories disseminated by the National Environmental Agency (NEA) [here](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

    - title: How can we prevent incipient outbreaks at the workplace?
      content: |
        You can do your part to guard against incipient outbreaks at the workplace through the following:

        - Adherence to Safe Management Measures at the workplace 
        - Ensuring employees at the workplace who have visited a clinic submit to you records of their Medical Certificates (MCs) and diagnoses provided (only for COVID-19-related symptoms, including acute respiratory infections), and if they were tested for COVID-19 and the results of their tests
        - Advising employees who are unwell to stay home and consult a doctor rather than going to the workplace
        - Requiring employees on MCs to closely monitor their health before returning to the workplace
        - Requiring close contacts of employees on MCs to monitor their health more regularly

- accordion:

  data:
    - title: What should be included in my monitoring plan?
      content: |
        The monitoring plan should at minimum, include details on the steps taken to ensure the requirements are communicated and adhered to, and how any anomalies or non-compliance will be identified. The plan should also highlight risk mitigation strategies and proposed steps to remedy and document any non-compliance found.

        You may refer to [Annex B](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-b-checklist-of-safe-management-measures.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} of the Safe Management Measures requirements, Checklist of Safe Management Measures at the Workplace for Resumption of Business Activities, for guidance on what should be included in the monitoring plan.

    - title: Who can we appoint as a Safe Management Officer?
      content: |
        Companies should appoint someone capable of carrying out the duties stated in MOM's requirements for workplace Safe Management Measures within the organisation as the designated Safe Management Officer(s) (SMOs). For unionised companies, union leaders or Workplace Safety and Health officers could be appointed as SMOs. 

        Companies should ensure that SMOs are provided with sufficient resources and guidance to carry out their duties effectively.

        SMOs can be part-time appointments.

    - title: How do I ensure that my employees adhere to Safe Management Measures?
      content: |
        Employers are responsible for ensuring that Safe Management Measures are in place, communicated and explained to employees prior to resuming work. Signs should also be put up to remind employers and visitors to observe all measures in place.

    - title: Can my company be exempted from Safe Management Measures when my employees are vaccinated?
      content: |
        We are still monitoring the duration of the vaccine's protection and its effectiveness in preventing transmission of COVID-19.

        Until enough people are vaccinated, you should continue to practise public health measures such as [Workplace Safe Management Measures](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. This will help to continue protect ourselves and our loved ones

    - title: 	Do I need to implement temperature screening for my employees?
      content: |
        No. This requirement was lifted on 19 August 2021.

    - title: What should I take into consideration when engaging employees on returning to the workplace?
      content: |
        You are encouraged to have a transparent and open discussion with employees on the work arrangements, taking into consideration factors such as: 
        
        - Business needs and nature of work, i.e. task requires employees to be physically in office
        - Readiness of workforce, e.g. infrastructure, IT support, onboarding of new hires, etc.
        - Implications on remuneration package, e.g. savings from office space rental, transport allowances, etc. 
        - Sensitivity towards certain groups of employees, i.e. older and more vulnerable employees, employees identified by MOH as not suitable to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, employees with caregiving needs

        Having a clear set of guidelines or workplace policies on the work arrangements would help prevent misunderstandings or disputes. 
        
        You may wish to refer to TAFEP's telecommuting guide for more details on implementing a sustainable telecommuting arrangement or to approach TAFEP on work-life programmes that can be implemented at the workplace. 

    - title: Do I need to conduct a deep cleaning of my workplace premises?
      content: |
        No. Common spaces include entrances, lifts lobbies, meeting rooms, pantries as well as shared machinery and equipment should be cleaned in accordance with [NEA's advisory](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/guidelines){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. You are not required to enlist a cleaning contractor. 

    - title: One of my workers is infected with COVID-19, and I want to conduct ART for employees who might have been in contact. What type of interactions should count?
      content: |
        You should make an assessment based on your workplace setting. For instance, those whom the infected worker had meals with, or those who were at a long meeting with them, may be at risk of infection. Even if they did not receive a Health Risk Warning, you may wish to conduct ART to ensure that they are safe and reduce transmission risk.

        It is important that employers ensure that the risk of transmission at the workplace is reduced to as low as possible even as we transit to an endemic situation. Otherwise, employers may face severe disruption to their operations if more workers are infected.

    - title: Who are included in the computation of my company's vaccination rate at https://go.gov.sg/percentvaccinated?
      content: |
        All your employees are included in the computation of your company's vaccination rate. This generally includes interns, temporary staff, and part-time staff. 
        
        Persons who are not employees, such as vendors, contractors, and consultants, are not included in the computation of your company's vaccination rate.

    - title: When is an employee considered vaccinated?
      content: |
        An employee is considered vaccinated if he/ she has been: a) fully vaccinated, i.e. has received the appropriate regimen of World Health Organisation Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines including their respective duration post-vaccination for the vaccine to be fully effective, and had their vaccination records ingested in MOH's national IT systems ; b) recovered from COVID-19 and within 270 days from the date of COVID-19 infection. 

    - title: Are employees who recovered from COVID-19 but unvaccinated counted towards the vaccination rate of the company?
      content: |
        Yes. Employees who recovered from COVID-19 will be counted to the vaccination rate if they are within 270 days from the date of COVID-19 infection. 

    - title: How do I check a specific employee's vaccination status? 
      content: |
        MOM is not able to provide the details of vaccinated and unvaccinated employees. As stated in the [Updated Advisory on COVID-19 Vaccination at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, employers may ask employees for their vaccination status for the purpose of planning deployment at the workplace.
