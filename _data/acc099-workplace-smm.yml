    - title: Who does the requirements apply to?
      content: |
       All businesses allowed to operate are required to have implemented Safe Management Measures.
       
       For companies resuming operations after the circuit breaker period, all Safe Management Measures should be in place before operations can be resumed at the workplace.

    - title: Why is work-from-home still the default as we transition out of Phase 2 Heightened Alert?
      content: |
        As we transition out of Phase 2 Heightened Alert in the coming weeks, it remains essential that we continue to keep transmission risks in check by reducing overall footfall and interactions at common spaces at or near the workplace, and in public places, including public transport. Therefore, work-from-home will continue to be the default during this transition period. Employers must provide the necessary facilities and direct their employees to work from home wherever possible. Only employees who are unable to work from home (e.g. work requiring access to equipment that is confined to the workplace) are permitted to continue working on-site. 

    - title: Do I have to apply to resume operations at my company’s workplace premises?
      content: |
        The Multi-Ministry Task Force has announced that selected activities and services are allowed to resume operations. Companies that fall under the list of activities and services do not need to apply before resuming operations. Please go to [https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg) for more details. 
        
    - title: Are the requirements mandatory, and what enforcement actions will MOM take against businesses that do not implement Safe Management Measures?
      content: |
        MOM and sector agencies will take calibrated enforcement actions based on the areas of non-compliance found. For workplaces that severely lack Safe Management Measures, we will direct employers to stop operations at the workplace. Employers will have to take steps to ensure that Safe Management Measures are in place before operations can resume.
        
        Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, failure to comply with Safe Management Measures is punishable with a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to 6 months or both.  Repeated non-compliance is punishable with a fine of up to $20,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both.

    - title: Who is empowered to enforce the requirements and how can I verify the identity of enforcement officers inspecting my workplace? 
      content: |
        Enforcement action may be taken by any of the following persons under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act:

        - A police officer;
        - A Health Officer appointed under section 4(1)(a) or (b) of the Infectious Diseases Act;
        - A public officer;
        - An officer of a statutory body;
        - An auxiliary police officer; and
        - An employee of a prescribed institution under the Infectious Diseases Act.

        You can verify the identity of enforcement officers via their authority cards or their public service identification cards.

    - title: Where can I find more guidance on implementing Safe Management Measures in the workplace?
      content: |
        You may refer to [Annex B of the Safe Management Measures requirements](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-b-checklist-of-safe-management-measures.pdf){:target="_blank"}, Checklist of Safe Management Measures at the Workplace for Resumption of Business Activities, for an overview of the requirements that must be fulfilled prior to resuming business activities at the workplace.
        
        Unionised companies are also encouraged to engage their unions on such arrangements.

    - title: Is it compulsory to fill in and maintain the checklist provided in Annex B?
      content: |
        [Annex B - Checklist of Safe Management Measures at the Workplace for Resumption of Business Activities](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-b-checklist-of-safe-management-measures.pdf){:target="_blank"} sets out the requirements needed for employers to resume operations. Employers are not required to fill out the checklist, but must ensure that the documents listed in the checklist (or equivalent) are available upon request by officials.
        
        When inspected by any government agency, businesses must be prepared to show that they have fulfilled the requirements listed. 

    - title: Are there specific Safe Management Measures for each sector (e.g. construction, F&B, retail)?
      content: |
        The requirements on Safe Management Measures at the workplace released by MOM is for general workplace settings. For specific workplace settings or sector requirements, please refer to [guidelines issued by the respective sector agencies](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector). 

    - title: We have received two advisories, one from MOM and another from the sector agency. Which one do we follow?
      content: |
        We have received two advisories, one from MOM and another from the sector agency. Which one do we follow?

    - title: My employees do not have a specific workplace as they are deployed to client’s site to provide goods and services. How can I implement Safe Management Measures?
      content: |
        All employers must implement Safe Management Measures at their workplaces for all employees and contractors. 
        
        Companies that have employees deployed to other sites should ensure that their employees comply with the Safe Management Measures put in place at these sites. In fact, some of the Safe Management Measures can be implemented by employers regardless of where employees are deployed, such as health monitoring.

    - title: If my business activities are not listed in the permitted services list, can I apply for an exemption to resume business activities?
      content: |
        Businesses should suspend operations in their premises from 7 April 2020 onwards until they are approved by MTI to continue operations or their list of business activity falls within the [permitted list](htps://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/faq/resumption/resumption/) allowed to operate from 2 June 2020.
        
        Employers whose business operations are not in the list of permitted services may still return to their business facility to take care of crucial tasks that cannot be done remotely or to retrieve necessary materials or documents. No application for exemption is required.
        
        However, if employees have to be activated to return to the workplace for short periods of time (i.e. less than a day), employers are required to apply to MTI for a time-limited exemption to do so. If employers need to maintain a skeletal workforce at the workplace for longer periods, an application for a general exemption should be submitted instead.

    - title: My company is currently operating under a General Exemption, as our business activities are currently not listed in the permitted services list. Can our employees who are currently working from home return to the workplace?
      content: |
        Companies operating under a General Exemption must submit an application for additional manpower via the GoBusiness portal, to allow more employees to return to the workplace.

    - title: What should I do if I see a business that is not in the permitted services list continuing to operate even though it is not supposed to?
      content: |
        Please report the incident to <u>covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg</u> and include relevant details such as company name, address and relevant evidence (e.g. photographs).

    - title: What should I do if my employer refuses to implement Safe Management Measures in the workplace?
      content: |
        If you notice any breach of Safe Management Measures or poor practices at the workplace, you can report it via [SnapSAFE](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/snapsafe){:target="_blank"}, an app that allows the reporting of workplace safety and health issues to MOM.
        
        MOM will treat each report seriously and will keep your identity strictly confidential.

    - title: Is there a limit to the number of migrant workers a company can deploy at each renovation site? 
      content: |
        Contractors should deploy a minimal number of workers at renovation workplaces and must ensure that Ministry of Manpower’s Safe Management Measures at workplaces are complied with at renovation workplaces to mitigate the risk of community transmission. All personnel on site must observe safe management measures such as clear physical distancing, wearing of masks and must avoid socialising or congregating in groups. 

    - title: If my renovation project involves more than one team of contractors, are they allowed to work at the same renovation site at the same time?
      content: |
        Different teams of contractors (main or sub-contractors) can carry out their respective work within the same renovation site, at the same time and day. However, all personnel on site must observe safe management measures such as clear physical distancing, wearing of masks and must avoid socialising or congregating in groups. 
        
        The application of safe management measures will vary depending on the renovation site. Employers should assess and evaluate the measures that must be taken to ensure safe distancing and ensure that the risk of COVID-19 spread at workplaces is minimised for their workers. This may include additional measures such as having staggered rest, arrival and exit timings to minimise interactions between workers from different companies.

    - title: Are companies that are operating required to ensure that their employees work from home?
      content: |
        From 16 May 2021 to 13 Jun 2021, work-from-home is the default mode of work and employers must provide the necessary facilities and direct their employees to work from home wherever possible.

        Work-from-home measures should be implemented in a sustainable manner that enables employees to maintain work-life harmony while continuing to meet business needs. The [tripartite advisory on mental well-being at workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/tripartite-advisory-on-mental-well-being-at-workplaces){:target="_blank"} sets out practical guidance on measures that employers can adopt to support their employees’ mental well-being. 

        A list of resources such as technology solutions and grants available to assist companies is available [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-a-resources-to-assist-companies.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

        Enforcement checks will be conducted and actions will be taken against businesses for non-compliance.

    - title: Is there a minimum percentage or number of workers that employers must place on work-from-home arrangements?
      content: |
        The objective of the requirements is to reduce physical interactions in the workplace in order to minimise spread of COVID-19. Employers should focus on providing the facilities necessary and directing every worker to work from home, as far as reasonably practicable. The proportion of employees that can do so will vary in different workplaces and sectors due to differing operational requirements. 

        The onus is on employers to show that they have made a reasonable effort to facilitate working from home, including reviewing and transforming business processes through technology to support remote working e.g. e-payment, e-invoicing, e-signatures.

    - title: Should my employees wear masks at all times? What should I do if my employee has a medical condition?
      content: |
        Everyone at the workplace should wear a mask at all times, except when eating, drinking, consuming medication or engaging in strenuous physical exercise. 

        However, if your employee has severe medical conditions which do not make it possible to wear a mask, they can wear a face shield in lieu of a mask.

    - title: What should I do if my employees are unwilling to work from home because their home is not conducive for work?
      content: |
        The objective of these regulations is to reduce physical interactions in order to prevent spread of COVID-19. Employers can consider different ways to implement working arrangements that comply with the Safe Management Measures for the workplace, while taking business and employee preferences into account.

    - title: As most of my employees are either doing frontline work or fieldwork operations, it is not feasible for me to rearrange the work such that they can work-from-home. Will I be penalised for not providing such work arrangements?
      content: |
        Employers must demonstrate the business or operational reasons why the workers working at the workplace are unable to work-from-home despite review and redesign of work processes. Inspectors will assess the efforts put in by companies to implement work-from-home arrangements based on the practicality of whether the workers can work-from-home given the nature of the job.

        For the safety of workers at the workplace, employers should put in place other Safe Management Measures at the workplace (e.g. ensuring safe distancing, ensuring use of SafeEntry, etc.) to provide a safe working environment and minimize risk of further outbreaks. 

        Special attention should also be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. persons who are aged 60 and above, and patients who are immunocompromised or have concurrent medical conditions) to enable them to work-from-home. Employers are encouraged to enable these employees to work-from-home, allow them to travel to/from work at off-peak timings, temporarily redeploy them to another role within the company, or take other appropriate measures to reduce their exposure to infection risk.

    - title: Is there a limit on the number of attendees in a physical meeting?
      content: |
        Employers should conduct virtual meetings as far as possible. Where physical meetings are assessed to be necessary, they are subject to a cap of 50 physical attendees and there must be 1m safe distancing between all individuals. Attendees must be masked.

    - title: Are companies required to ensure staggered start times and implement flexible workplace hours for employees at the workplace?
      content: |
        Employers are encouraged to stagger the start times for all employees who are unable to work from home (due to the nature of their work, or their work can only be done with equipment that is confined to the workplace) such that at least half of all employees arrive at the workplace at or after 10am, as far as possible. This would enable more employees to avoid peak-hour travel, especially if employees require the use of public transport. Timings of lunch and other breaks should also be staggered accordingly.

    - title: Can I carry on with the work-related event I have planned between 16 May and 13 June, given the tighter measures that were announced for this period?
      content: |
        Employers are strongly encouraged to consider rescheduling or convert to virtual those work-related events that are not critical, in view of the recent trends in community transmission of COVID-19. 

        If employers assess that the physical work-related event is critical, they may proceed with strict implementation of SMM.  

        i.	The number of persons per event must be capped at 50 persons to limit the risk of exposure to infection.

        ii.	Attendees must maintain at least 1 metre safe distancing between individual attendees, as per the requirement at the workplace.

        iii.	Food and drinks are not allowed at work-related events.

    - title: How do I know if my foreign workers can leave their residence for work?
      content: |
        You can now use the AccessCode on the SGWorkPass app to check if your foreign employees can leave their residence (dormitory or non-dormitory housing) for work. The status of your employees' AccessCode takes into account 3 broad parameters:
        - Their health

        - Their residential address

        - Whether your company and/or worker is allowed to operate

        They can only leave for work if their AccessCode is 'Green' (can go out for work).

        However, if their AccessCode is 'Red' (cannot go out for work), they are not allowed to leave for work.

    - title: Am I able to access all my workers' AccessCode status and details, instead of checking individually using the SGWorkPass?
      content: |
        From 12 July 2020, employers can download the AccessCode details of their workers from a new [Safe@Work eService](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/safe-work){:target="_blank"}. For a start, AccessCode statuses of workers who hold a Work Permit or S Pass will be available. 

        Please refer to the [Safe@Work eService onboarding guide](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/safety-health/user-guides/safe-work/user-guide-safe-work.pdf?la=en&hash=58E40C481AF9D908461569E56A92AD6D){:target="_blank"} for more information.

    - title: My worker's AccessCode is 'Red' and his AccessCode details shows 'No approval to start work'. What should I do?
      content: |
        This means your company has not been given approval to operate, and/or your workers are not allowed to start work.

        All companies should check the [GoBusiness Portal](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/covid/){:target="_blank"} to find out if they are allowed to operate. Please approach your respective lead agencies for assistance:

    - title: How do I update my foreign employee’s residential address?
      content: |
        You can update their residential address using: 

        - [Online Foreign Worker Address Service (OFWAS)](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/ofwas){:target="_blank"} for Work Permit holders
        - [EP Online](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/ep-online){:target="_blank"} for Employment Pass and S Pass holders 

        Their AccessCode will be refreshed 1 - 2 days after their addresses are updated in OFWAS or EP Online. If their AccessCode is not refreshed, it may mean:

        - Your worker has failed to scan the QR code in his room using the FWMOMCare App; or
        - the dormitory operators' record is not updated. Please contact the dormitory operator to rectify this.

    - title: What can employees of firms which are not allowed to operate do, if they are told to leave the company due to refusal to report to work?
      content: |
        Employees who have been wrongfully dismissed may file a claim against the wrongful dismissal or make a phone advisory appointment with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) at [https://www.tal.sg/tadm/eServices](https://www.tal.sg/tadm/eServices){:target="_blank"}. 

        For more information on what constitutes a wrongful dismissal, please refer to the [Tripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/termination-of-employment/unfair-dismissal#what-is-a-wrongful-dismissal){:target="_blank"}.

    - title: Can my workers who are staying in dormitories walk or take their own personal transport (e.g. bicycle, motorcycles) to and from their worksites?
      content: |
        As an employer, you must provide transport for your workers to and from their worksites.

        If the worksite is located nearby (e.g. <1km away) and there are no community areas en-route, you can allow your worker to walk or cycle.

        When allowing workers to walk or cycle between dormitories and worksites, you must demonstrate that you have complied with the relevant safe management measures upon request by enforcement officers. You must ensure that your workers wear their masks at all times, and that they only travel to and from their worksites with no stops in between.

        Workers are not allowed to ride motorcycles to and from their worksites under any circumstances.

        More details on implementing safe management measures for workers on employer-provided transportation can be found [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-safe-management-measures-for-workers-on-transportation){:target="_blank"}.

    - title: Can my workers who are staying in dormitories take taxis or private hire vehicles (e.g. Grab, GoJek) to and from their worksites?
      content: |
        As an employer, you must provide transport for your workers to and from their worksites.

        You can use taxis or private hire vehicles (PHVs) as long as you:

        - Work with taxi or PHV operators to pre-arrange and pre-pay for such vehicles to ferry the workers to ensure availability of vehicles and reduce physical interactions between drivers and workers.

        - Work with dormitory operators to plan and coordinate pick-up times so as to reduce congestion.

        AND

        - Are able to demonstrate that you have complied with the relevant safe management measures upon request.

        You must ensure that your workers wear their masks at all times, check in using SafeEntry, and that they go directly to and from their worksites with no stops in between.

        More details on implementing safe management measures for workers on employer-provided transportation can be found [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-safe-management-measures-for-workers-on-transportation){:target="_blank"}.
