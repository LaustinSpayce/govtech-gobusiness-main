  - title: What is the Progressive Wage (PW) Mark? What firms are eligible for it?
    content: |
      The PW is an accreditation scheme that recognises firms that pay progressive wages to lower-wage workers. It enables consumers and corporate buyers to easily identify and support such firms.

      A firm that employs at least one local resident worker (i.e. Singapore citizens and permanent residents) covered by the prevailing Sectoral Progressive Wages (SPW) or Occupational Progressive Wages (OPW) under the Progressive Wage Model that have taken effect will be eligible to apply for the PW Mark. 

      To be accredited with the PW Mark, the firm must (i) pay the relevant worker(s) according to the SPW or OPW requirements, and (ii) pay all other local resident workers at least the Local Qualifying Salary (LQS). 

      Firms may refer to [Ministry of Manpower (MOM)'s website](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/progressive-wage-model){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to check the wage schedules and job descriptions of occupations covered by the prevailing SPW and OPW, to determine whether their workers should be classified under SPW and/or OPW, and the progressive wages that apply to them. 

      If firms are uncertain on the classification of the workers or have disagreements with their workers on the classification, they may submit a query to MOM for clarifications and advice at [mom_lrwd@mom.gov.sg](mailto:mom_lrwd@mom.gov.sg). MOM will follow up with these firms.

  - title: What is the difference between the Progressive Wage (PW) Mark and PW Mark Plus?
    content: |
      The PW Mark and PW Mark Plus are two separate tiers in the same accreditation framework.

      Firms can obtain the PW Mark by paying applicable employees the prevailing Sectoral or Occupational Progressive Wages that apply to them, and paying all other local employees at least the Local Qualifying Salary. 

      PW Mark Plus is a higher tier of accreditation conferred to firms that on top of paying the Progressive Wages laid out above, they also commit to advance the well-being of lower-wage workers by adopting the [Tripartite Standard on Advancing Well-Being of Lower-Wage Workers](https://www.tal.sg/tafep/getting-started/progressive/tripartite-standards#lower-wage-workers){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

  - title: How many Progressive Wage (PW) Mark can I apply for?
    content: |
      Each firm can only have one PW Mark accreditation (i.e. either PW Mark or PW Mark Plus) at any one time. 

  - title: My firm already has Progressive Wage (PW) Mark. How can I apply for PW Mark Plus?
    content: |
      To be accredited with the PW Mark Plus, firms that already qualify for the PW Mark will need to adopt the [Tripartite Standard on Advancing Well-Being of Lower-Wage Workers (TS-LWW)](https://www.tal.sg/tafep/getting-started/progressive/tripartite-standards#lower-wage-workers){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, which recognises firms that adopt practices to advance the well-being of lower-wage workers beyond raising wages. 

      The TS-LWW outlines a set of progressive workplace practices to provide better workplace support for our lower-wage workers in the areas of training and career development, workplace safety and health, and rest area provision. 

      You may apply to upgrade your firm's PW Mark accreditation to PW Mark Plus by either: 

      - submitting a new application for PW Mark Plus on GoBusiness, which includes the adoption of the TS-LWW (if not already an existing adopter); or 

      - applying to adopt the TS-LWW via Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices' (TAFEP) website directly. More information is available [here](https://www.tal.sg/tafep/getting-started/progressive/tripartite-standards){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. For queries on Tripartite Standards, you may email TAFEP at [ts@tafep.sg](mailto:ts@tafep.sg).  

      Once your TS-LWW adoption has been successful, your firm's PW Mark accreditation will be upgraded automatically.

  - title: How can I maintain or renew my accreditation?
    content: |
      The accreditation is valid for one year from the date of approval.

      As long as your firm continues to meet the eligibility for the Progressive Wage (PW) Mark or PW Mark Plus, it will be renewed automatically and there is no need to submit another application to maintain your accreditation when the current one expires. 

      To facilitate auto-renewal of the accreditation, your firm should continue to pay the relevant local workers the relevant Sectoral or Occupational Progressive Wages, and all other local workers at least the Local Qualifying Salary.

      Your firm will need to update the [Occupational Employment Dataset (OED)](https://stats.mom.gov.sg/laboursurvey/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} as and when there are changes to the occupational and employment details of your employees. If there are no changes to the information you have provided, no further action is required from you. The system will automatically populate the records for you if there are no changes from month to month.

      For queries related to the OED, you may contact the Manpower Research & Statistics Department under Ministry of Manpower directly at 6320 7722 (Monday - Friday, 8:30am to 5:30pm) or send them an email enquiry at [MOM_OED@mom.gov.sg](mailto:MOM_OED@mom.gov.sg).

  - title: Where can I download my PW Mark e-Certificate?
    content: |
      Once you have received an email to notify you that your firm's PW Mark application has been approved, you may log in to GoBusiness to download your PW Mark e-Certificate from your dashboard.

  - title: Can I get the Progressive Wage (PW) Mark even if I do not hire any workers under Sectoral PW or Occupational PW?
    content: |
      You are eligible for [PW Mark](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/progressive-wage-model/progressive-wage-mark){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} only if you hire at least one local worker covered by the prevailing Sectoral PW or Occupational PW that has taken effect, and will be accredited if you pay these relevant workers according to the Progressive Wage requirements. 

      If you do not hire local workers under Sectoral PW or Occupational PW, your firm is not eligible for the PW Mark. 

      However, you can still demonstrate your efforts to uplift lower-wage workers by adopting the [Tripartite Standard on Advancing Well-Being of Lower-Wage Workers (TS-LWW)](https://www.tal.sg/tafep/getting-started/progressive/tripartite-standards#lower-wage-workers){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, which recognises firms that adopt practices to advance the well-being of lower-wage workers. This includes providing support to help lower-wage workers upskill, and providing access to proper and reasonable rest areas for lower-wage workers working in your premises.

  - title: My firm is a government supplier. Do I need to get the Progressive Wage (PW) Mark?
    content: |
      For new tenders called from 1 March 2023 and quotations from 1 March 2024, the Government will require awarded suppliers and their subcontractors to be accredited with the PW Mark for the contract period, if they are eligible for it. 

      Suppliers and their subcontractors who do not hire any workers covered by Sectoral PWs or Occupational PWs are ineligible for the PW Mark. Hence, they are not required to be accredited.

      We encourage potential suppliers who hire at least one local worker covered by Sectoral PWs or Occupational PWs to apply for and obtain the PW Mark in advance to be in good stead to fulfilL the government procurement terms.

  - title: Can I adopt the Tripartite Standard on Advancing Well-Being of Lower-Wage Workers (TS-LWW) if I do not hire any lower-wage workers?
    content: |
      Yes, you are encouraged to adopt the [TS-LWW](https://www.tal.sg/tafep/getting-started/progressive/tripartite-standards#lower-wage-workers){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Although it focuses on lower-wage workers' needs, the practices (e.g. to provide rest areas for workers) are also applicable to other groups of workers, including outsourced lower-wage workers.

      Adopting the TS-LWW will reflect your commitment to adhere to these practices if you hire lower-wage workers in the future. 

      Firms applying only to adopt the TS-LWW, and not the PW Mark Plus, may do so directly on [Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices' (TAFEP) website](https://www.tal.sg/tafep/getting-started/progressive/adopt-tripartite-standards){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
