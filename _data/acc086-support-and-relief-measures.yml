  - title: What is the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS)? 
    content: |
        The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) provides wage support to employers, to help enterprises retain their local employees (Singaporean Citizens and Permanent Residents) during this period of economic uncertainty. Under the JSS, the Government co-funds a proportion of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each local employee up to March 2021. In Budget 2021, JSS was extended by up to 6 months for firms in Tiers 1 and 2 sectors, covering wages paid from April 2021 to September 2021. The level and duration of support each employer receives depends on the sector in which the employer operates.

  - title: What financial assistance will be available to F&B outlets for the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) phase from 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021?  
    content: |
        With the implementation of the tightening measures, all F&B outlets will no longer be able to offer dining-in services. Delivery and take-away services can continue. 

        To provide some relief for F&B business owners and employees, the Government will increase the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) co-funding available to F&B business owners for the duration of the tightened measures, i.e. from 16 May to 6 June 2021 (both dates inclusive), from 10% today to 50% of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each local employee. For details on the JSS, please refer to IRASâ€™s website at [https://go.gov.sg/jss](https://go.gov.sg/jss){:target="_blank"}.

        The Government will also provide one month of rental waiver for hawker stalls and coffeeshop tenants of government agencies. Commercial landlords are urged to support their F&B tenants through this period. 

  - title: What financial assistance will be available to personal care businesses which have to cease activities that cannot be conducted with masks on? Examples include beauty salons offering facials and saunas.
    content: |
        We recognize that personal care services span a wide range of activities, many of which can continue to operate under the tightened measures as both customers and service providers are able to keep their masks on. Establishments whose revenues are significantly affected may appeal to [IRAS](https://go.gov.sg/jssappeals){:target="_blank"} here. 

  - title: Is the Government considering additional support to the tourism and retail sectors in view of the tightened measures?
    content: |
        The tourism and retail sectors can still operate during this period of tightened measures. Businesses that face cashflow challenges can continue to tap on the extended Temporary Bridging Loan Programme and enhanced Enterprise Financing Scheme, and we encourage businesses to make full use of these schemes.
