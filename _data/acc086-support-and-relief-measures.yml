  - title: What is the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS)? 
    content: |
      The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) provides wage support to employers, to help enterprises retain their local employees (Singaporean Citizens and Permanent Residents) during this period of economic uncertainty. Under the JSS, the Government co-funds a proportion of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each local employee.

      The level and duration of support each employer receives depends on the sector in which the employer operates. As JSS payouts are intended to offset and protect local employees’ wages, employers who put local employees on mandatory no-pay leave (NPL) or retrench them will not be eligible for JSS payouts for those employees.

      **Enhancements to the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS)**

      For sectors where the tightened measures require them to suspend many, if not all of their operations, the Government will enhance JSS support to 50% for the period from 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021. This will provide support to F&B establishments, and affected gyms, fitness studios, performing arts organisations, and arts education centres.

      For sectors that are not required to suspend operations but are significantly affected by the tightened measures, the Government will enhance JSS support to 30% from 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021. This will provide support to the businesses in the retail sector, affected personal care services, museums, art galleries, historical sites, cinemas, indoor playgrounds and other family entertainment centres.

      **Rental support for qualifying tenants of commercial properties**

      The Government will provide rental relief to SMEs, and eligible non-profit organisations with an annual revenue not exceeding $100 million, who are tenant-occupiers of qualifying commercial properties.

      For Government-owned commercial properties, the Government will grant one month of rental relief for qualifying tenants, as well as hawker stalls and coffee shops. Tenants will be required to pass down the rental relief received to qualifying sub-tenants, if any.

      For privately-owned commercial properties, the Government will disburse a 0.5-month rental relief cash payout directly to qualifying tenants as part of a new Rental Support Scheme. Property owners who run an SME business or non-profit organisation on their own property will also be eligible for the cash payout. 

      **COVID-19 Recovery Grant (Temporary) (CRG-T)**

      The CRG-T scheme will provide one-off support for lower- to middle-income employees and self-employed persons who are financially impacted as a result of the tightened measures. Individuals who experience at least one month of involuntary no-pay leave or income loss of at least 50% for at least one month, during the period between 16 May 2021 and 30 June 2021, may apply for CRG-T. Eligible individuals placed on involuntary no-pay leave may receive a one-off payout of up to $700, and those experiencing significant income loss may receive a one-off payout of up to $500. Applications will be open from 3 June 2021 to 2 July 2021.

      Under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), most firms can still operate. Businesses that face cashflow challenges can continue to tap on the extended Temporary Bridging Loan Programme and enhanced Enterprise Financing Scheme, and we encourage businesses to make full use of these schemes.

      Establishments whose revenues are significantly affected and wish to appeal to receive a higher tier of the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) may do so [here](https://go.gov.sg/jssappeals){:target="_blank"}.
