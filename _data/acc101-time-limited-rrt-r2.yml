    - title: Why is MOH conducting a second round of ART kit distribution to workplaces?
      content: |
        With more employees returning to the workplace from 1 Jan 2022, there could be higher risk of workplace transmission, particularly given the higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant. Regular testing is therefore important to ensure early detection and ringfencing of cases at the workplace. To support this practice, the Government is undertaking a second round of ART kit distribution which eligible companies can apply for. The application period will be from 3 Jan 2022 through to 31 Jan 2022.

    - title: Which companies are eligible to apply for kits?
      content: |
        Companies with <u>fully vaccinated*</u> employees who <u>work onsite</u> and who <u>are not already subject to the Government's mandatory PCR or FET RRT regime</u>, may apply for 8 ART kits per onsite fully vaccinated employee for weekly testing over a two-month period. This includes full-time, part-time employees, interns or vendors who will return to office at least once a week over a 2-month period. 

        <i>*Note: employees who are (i) certified to be medically ineligible, or (ii) unvaccinated and recovered from COVID-19 infection within 180 days as of 31 March 2022, may apply for the ART kits as well.</i>

    - title: Why is it that only fully vaccinated employees are eligible for the free ART kits?
      content: |
        Non-fully vaccinated staff are already subject to MOM’s Workforce Vaccination Measures from 1 Jan 2022, where they have to pay for their own PET before returning to the workplace. They will therefore not be eligible for the free ART kits issued by the Government to workplaces. From 15 Jan 2022, this concession for non-fully vaccinated persons to return to the workplace with a negative PET result will also be removed i.e. they will not be allowed to return to office at all.  

    - title: If employees are working on a split-team arrangement and returning to office on alternate days or weeks, are they eligible for the kits? 
      content: |
        Companies may apply for staff who are returning to office on alternate days or weeks so long as they are fully vaccinated and not already under the mandatory RRT regime. These staff should continue to self-test on weeks when they are working from home over the 2-month period.  

    - title: Are home-based business owner/self-employed persons eligible to apply for the ART kits?
      content: |
        Businesses which are UEN-registered and have a valid Corppass will be eligible to apply for kits for fully vaccinated employee(s) who work on-site and are not already under the mandatory RRT regime. 

    - title: My employees are on FET RRT and we are running out of kits for this month. However, we have yet to receive additional kits for the next month. Can we apply for this second round of Time-Limited RRT to get the kits first?
      content: |
        Companies with employees on mandatory FET RRT should not obtain additional kits meant for mandatory testing by applying for this second round of Time-Limited RRT. For companies who are running out of kits, they should contact their respective FET RRT Sector Lead agencies for follow-up on the kits replenishment. 

    - title: Can companies with employees that meet the eligibility criteria choose not to apply for the ART test kits?
      content: |
        Applying for the ART kits is voluntary. Nevertheless, companies are strongly encouraged to do so.  

    - title: Can my company apply for additional kits, in case of invalid test results?
      content: |
        Invalid results are rare. If there are insufficient test kits arising from re-testing due to invalid results, your company may choose to purchase additional kits to complete the regime for the affected employee(s). Otherwise, if the kits issued by the Government are used for re-testing and this leads to fewer kits being available for employees, companies should indicate under the “Remarks” field when submitting the results declaration form to account for the lower number of staff tested. 

    - title: I applied for the first round of kits distribution in Sep 2021. Am I still eligible to apply for this second round of kits distribution? 
      content: |
        Yes, your company may still apply for the ART kits for the employees who fulfill the eligibility criteria. , if you have finished utilising the test kits from first round of kits distribution. 

        If your company still has test kits left from the first round of kits distribution, you may use them for weekly testing of onsite employees over the next 8 weeks. If the kits left are not sufficient, you may apply for this second round of kits distribution nearer to the end of January, to begin testing for this second round soon after receiving the kits. Please also note that you should finish utilising the test kits from the first round of distribution before using the test kits from this second round of distribution. You should also continue to submit the results declaration via the respective FormSG links for both rounds of kits distribution at the end of each month of testing.
        
        As part of the ongoing audit for the first round of kits distribution, there will be companies who are identified as non-compliant as they have failed to submit results and/or produce the proof of documents as required during audit. The Government therefore reserves the right to reject applications from such companies under this second round of kits distribution. 

    - title: I missed the application period for the first round of kits distribution in Sep 2021. Can I apply for additional kits per onsite employee (up to 16 kits) for this second round of distribution? 
      content: |
        Applications for the first round of ART kits distribution has ended on 13 October 2021. Companies who participate in the second round of distribution should only apply for 8 kits per onsite employee.  

    - title: I did not apply for the first round of kits distribution in Sep/Oct 2021, but am keen to apply for this second round of distribution. However, my company is still working from home and have no plans to return to office at this time. Can I still apply for kits?
      content: |
        If your company has no plans to return to office until March 2022, there is no need to apply for this second round of distribution. This is because the kits are meant for testing during a time-limited period in January and February, where we expect an uptick in the number of Omicron cases at workplaces. 

        For companies who plan to return to office earlier than March e.g. in February, you may wish to apply for the test kits towards the end of the application period (i.e. end-Jan). This will allow you to begin testing as soon as possible after receiving the test kits, and facilitate your reporting requirements.

    - title: I have already applied for the second round of kits distribution, but my company is still working from home. Do I need to return the kits?
      content: |
        You do not have to return the kits but your company will need to submit results twice over the next 8 weeks from the time of receipt of kits (i.e. once at the end of each month’s testing cycle), to indicate how many employees have been tested, and explain the shortfall if need be.

        Upon return to office, you will need to commence testing and continue submitting results on a monthly basis until testing is complete.

    - title: I started my weekly voluntary testing regime, but have an employee who tested positive at a GP in the first week, and was subsequently given the ‘recovered’ status which exempts him from Pre-Event Testing. Will he also be exempted from the Time-Limited RRT when he comes back to work?
      content: |
        The employee may still use the test kits for weekly testing when he returns to the workplace. Companies may use the test kits for testing of onsite employees who are fully vaccinated (including those who have recovered), those certified to be medically ineligible, or unvaccinated and recovered from COVID-19 infection within 180 days.

    - title: Does my company have to submit my employees' test results to the government?
      content: |
        Companies are required to declare the total number of employees tested, along with the number of Ag+ results recorded, in the ART results declaration form at the end of each month's testing cycle (i.e. twice across the two-month period) to the Government. The results declaration may be submitted via this link: [https://go.gov.sg/round-2-tlrrt-results-submissions](https://go.gov.sg/round-2-tlrrt-results-submissions){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Kindly note that this link will be made available only from February 2022 onwards.  

        The detailed results of each individual employee do not need to be submitted to the Government. However, companies are expected to retain the test results up to 1 month after they have completed the 8-week testing, and be required to produce proof if audited by the government.

    - title: What processes should my company have in place to ensure that we are compliant?
      content: |
        Companies should have processes in place to ensure that the weekly tests are conducted properly, test results are recorded, and appropriate follow-up actions are adhered to. 

        If audited by the government, companies should be able to produce proof (e.g. email records, circulars, excel documents etc.) that such processes have been put in place and implemented.

        You may refer to this link for self-test instructions for the SD Biosensor kits which you have received.  

        You may also follow the step-by-step instructions available here or obtain more information from go.gov.sg/selftestart. 

    - title: Is ART painful?
      content: |
        ART is conducted by inserting a swab stick approximately 2cm into the nostril. These swabs are shallower and less intrusive than the nasopharyngeal swabs taken for PCR tests. Users may experience some discomfort, but the swabs should not be painful.

    - title: Is frequent ART swabbing harmful to me?
      content: |
        Frequent swabbing has not been proven to be harmful. ART swabs are inserted at around 2cm into the nostril, which are shallower and less intrusive than the nasopharyngeal swabs taken for PCR tests. However, if you have had recent facial surgery or frequent nose bleeds, you are advised to visit a licensed ART provider to have a professional perform the ART for you.

    - title: If I am feeling unwell on the day of testing (i.e. have sore throat, cough or fever), should I still proceed to do the test?
      content: |
        If you are experiencing acute respiratory symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, flu or runny nose), you may visit a primary care provider who will assess your condition and administer the relevant tests.

    - title: What do my results mean?
      content: |
        Negative: Even if you test negative, please stay vigilant. Do continue to observe safe distancing measures and practice good personal hygiene such as regular handwashing and wearing a mask when leaving your home. Continue to monitor your health and test yourself where necessary.

        Positive: If you are well and do not have symptoms, please isolate yourself and re-test yourself with further ART tests after 72 hours from the initial positive test. You may resume normal activities if you test negative. If it is positive, continue to self-isolate and repeat antigen rapid tests at least one day apart. You can stop self-isolation and resume daily activities when it tests negative. If you feel unwell e.g. fever, cough, sore throat at any point in time, please visit a primary care doctor for further assessment. 

        Invalid: An invalid test may mean that the test was not performed correctly, or the test kit was faulty. You should re-read the instructions on how to perform the test and repeat an ART with a new test kit until you get a valid ART result. You may also consider undergoing a self-paid ART which is supervised or done by a healthcare provider, such as at Quick Test Centres or medical clinics. 

    - title: What should I do if I experience nose bleeding after swabbing?
      content: |
        Please consult a doctor if you experience persistent nose bleeding.

    - title: How should I dispose the used test kit?
      content: |
        After reading the results, please take a photo with your ID in the same photo if the result is positive or both results are invalid.

        To dispose the test kit, place all the used items from the test kit into a plastic bag or a sealable bag and seal it. Place the sealed bag into another plastic bag. Tie the second plastic bag with a rubber band or cable tie. Please ensure that the bags are tightly tied to protect your community. Throw it into the rubbish chute or a pedal bin immediately.

        You should isolate yourself at home if you are well and test positive. 

        After 72 hours, repeat an ART. You can resume daily activities if it tests negative. If it is positive, continue to self-isolate and repeat ARTs at least one day apart. You can stop self-isolation and resume daily activities when it tests negative.

        If you feel unwell e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, please visit a primary care provider to be assessed medically.

    - title: What should I do as part of self-isolation?
      content: |
        You should take steps and make arrangements to make sure that you can isolate yourself from other persons in your household. You should minimise interactions with other household members, and practise good hygiene habits. These include:
        
        * Staying in a room on your own as much as possible and keeping the door closed
        
        * If you have to share a bathroom, clean it each time you use it by wiping surfaces
        
        * Wash your hands often
        
        * Keep the windows open to ensure the house is well-ventilated

        You are advised not to leave home unless to seek medical care for COVID-19.

    - title: What should I do if I do not have an ART test to do the repeat tests?
      content: |
        You may use the ART kits that your company has applied for you to conduct the repeat tests. If that is not available or accessible, your family and friends can help to purchase or you can purchase them online.

    - title: If I test ART positive, when should I proceed to receive a confirmatory PCR test instead of self-isolating? 
      content: |
        You are not required to receive a confirmatory PCR test unless your primary care provider advises you to do so. 

    - title: What should my household members, colleagues or close contacts do if I am ART positive?
      content: |
        If you test ART positive during your visit to a primary care provider where you received a healthcare-administered ART, Health Risk Warnings (HRW) will be issued to your close contacts, including those identified through the TraceTogether app and self-declaration of household members. Persons issued with HRW should follow the prevailing Protocol 3. 

        If you had tested ART positive via a self-administered ART. Your close contacts will not be issued a HRW. However, we advise that they take the following precautions:
        
        * <b>Minimise contact with the person who had tested ART positive</b>
        
        * <b>Take an ART self-test within 24 hours of their last contact with the person</b>
        
        * <b>Should they need to leave home over the next 7 days, e.g. to work or to school, take an ART self-test on the same day</b>
        
          1. <b>If negative, they may leave home</b>

          2. <b>If positive, follow the instructions for persons tested ART positive.</b>

        During the 7-day period, avoid unnecessary interactions with others as much as possible. 

    - title: My employee has tested ART positive, can I require that he/she undergoes a confirmatory PCR test?
      content: |
        Companies should not require employees to undergo a confirmatory PCR test unless the employee visits a primary care doctor who advises him/her to do so. 

    - title: My employee has tested ART negative after having tested positive initially. Is it safe for him/her to return to work?
      content: |
        As long as a person without symptoms has tested negative on the antigen test that was done at least 72 hours after the initial positive test, the person can return to work safely. 

        There is no need for PCR testing before the person returns to work.
