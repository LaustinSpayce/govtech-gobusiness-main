    - title: These additional measures have impacted my business greatly. How is the Government supporting us?
      content: |
        (i)	Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for affected sectors
        In view of the continued tightened safe management measures of various activities until mid-July 2021, the Government will extend the current enhancements to the JSS for affected sectors by 3 weeks (starting 21 June) before tapering it down to 10% for the subsequent 2 weeks. Please refer to the [annex](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex-b-mtf-18-jun.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details. 

        (ii)	Support to hawkers who are self-employed 
        To support hawkers and coffeeshop stallholders who are self-employed, the Government will extend the subsidies for fees for table-cleaning and centralized dishwashing services, and will provide rental waivers, till mid-July 2021 for stallholders in centres managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators.

        (iii)	E-commerce Booster Package
        ESG reintroduced support measure to help affected retail businesses diversify their revenue channels and defray business costs of going online:<br>
        - The E-Commerce Booster Package provides up to 80% support for local retailers to get on-board local e-commerce platforms, and will be available from 16 May 2021 to 16 November 2021.

        <u>Rental Support Scheme</u>
        Rental support for SME of Commercial Properties during two P2HA periods, disbursed by IRAS to qualifying tenants:
        - Half-month rental relief cash payout (payout from Aug 2021)
        - Half-month rental relief cash payout (payout from Oct 2021)

    - title: Will there be updates on the GoBusiness portal for businesses, e.g. what are the permissible activities?
      content: |
        Please refer to the Safe Management Measures and guidelines stipulated in the sector-specific advisories on the GoBusiness portal.

    - title: Am I allowed to operate at full capacity during this time?  Or must we limit work to specific hours or at certain manpower limits?
      content: |
        From 19 August 2021, up to 50% of employees who are able to work from home are allowed to return to the workplace at any point in time. Employers can consider other arrangements that will meet this requirement, for instance: 

        -	Divide employees into 2 groups, with 1 group working from home for any given week. 
        
        -	Divide employees into 2 groups, with a different group working from home for each day Monday to Thursday, and both groups working from home on Fridays.   

    - title: Do I need to send my staff for regular testing? 
      content: |
        All employees who work at settings with unmasked clients/patron, or where there is prolonged contact between individuals, are required to be placed on a regular Fast and Easy Tests (FET) regime using tests such as antigen rapid tests (ART). These include staff of:

        a.  Dine-in F&B establishments; 
        b.  Personal care services (e.g. nail services, massage establishments, hairdressing); and
        c.  Gyms and fitness studios where clients are unmasked.

        The regular FET for staff at these settings is mandatory. From 13 September 2021, the frequency of the FET RRT has been increased to once every 7 days to facilitate the earlier detection and ringfencing of cases. 

    - title: Why do I need to send my staff for regular testing?
      content: |
        Identified settings are of higher risk, as clients/patrons are unmasked while in close proximity to one another for prolonged periods of time. Employees who work at these settings would therefore need to undergo a 7-day regular FET with effect from 13 September 2021.

    - title: What is the cost of getting the antigen rapid tests (ART)?
      content: |
        For establishments that are placed on mandatory Fast and Easy Tests (FET) regime, the costs for the ART kits and training programmes for supervisors will be borne by the Government until 31 December 2021.

        For those who wish to purchase the ART self-test kits, they are available at all major pharmacies in Singapore, and their retail prices range from $10 to $13 per test kit. Companies can also refer to the list of distributors at [https://www.hsa.gov.sg/consumer-safety/articles//details/covid19_ARTselftests](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/consumer-safety/articles//details/covid19_ARTselftests){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. 

    - title: How do I organise/conduct mandatory testing for my employees?
      content: |
        The mandatory Fast and Easy Testing (FET) and Vaccinate or Regular Testing (VoRT) regimes for all establishments will be conducted via Employer-Supervised Self Swab (ESSS) where employees will swab themselves under the supervision of a trained staff (‘supervisor’). Supervision can be done either in-person or virtually.

        To support establishments in implementing the ESSS testing regime, cost for the supervisor’s training will be paid by the government until 31 December 2021. Enterprises must send 1 or 2 supervisors per outlet to undergo the training session to be qualified to supervise the employees’ self-swab.  

        Please refer to [https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/covid-19/fast-and-easy-testing](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/covid-19/fast-and-easy-testing){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more information on FET. 

    - title: I own a small business and am unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on my own. What should I do?
      content: |
        We encourage all businesses with at least 2 staff to conduct employer supervised self-swabs for their employees. 
        
        However, for small businesses (e.g. hawkers or establishments with only 1 employee) who are unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on their own, the government will set up Quick Test Centres (QTCs) to support those who need to be tested. 

        Businesses can refer to SFA's guide for onboarding for testing at Quick Test Centres (QTCs) instead [https://www.sfa.gov.sg/covid-19/mandatory-fast-and-easy-testing-(fet)-regime-for-all-outlet-employees-at-dine-in-f-b-establishments](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/covid-19/mandatory-fast-and-easy-testing-(fet)-regime-for-all-outlet-employees-at-dine-in-f-b-establishments){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Please refer to the section on "How to onboard by Quick Test Centre?” on the steps required.

    - title: Can F&B establishments allow dine-in options?
      content: |
        From 10 Aug, F&B establishments are allowed to continue food service operations, with the exceptions of PBND SFA license categories or SSIC codes starting with 5613.

        F&B establishments including food courts are permitted to seat dine-in groups of up to 5 pax with vaccine differentiated SMMs (VDS) in place
        
        - VDS eligibility criteria are as follows:

          a.  Fully vaccinated, i.e. has received the appropriate regimen of World Health Organisation Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines (e.g. Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty, Moderna, AstraZeneca-SKBio, Serum Institute of India, Janssen, Sinopharm, Sinovac-CoronaVac) including their respective duration post-vaccination for the vaccine to be fully effective and had their vaccination records captured in MOH’s national IT systems<sup>1</sup> ; or

          b.  Recovered from COVID-19, i.e. less than 270 days of first positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result obtained in Singapore, and can provide a valid Pre-Event Test (PET) exemption notice for the duration of his/her dine-in<sup>2</sup> from an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider; or

          c.  Have a valid negative PET result for the duration of his/her dine-in<sup>3</sup> obtained from an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider in the past 24 hours.

        - Dine-in is not allowed if any individual within a group of up to 5 persons does not meet the eligibility criteria above. Allowing this would be an offence.

        - Children aged 12 years and below who are unvaccinated are eligible for vaccination-differentiated SMMs and may be included in the group of up to 5 persons. If there is more than one such child in the group, all children must be from the same household. F&B establishments are to ensure that there is no mixing or mingling between different groups.   

        Hawker centres/ coffee shops/ canteens

        - A special concession will be given to allow vaccinated and unvaccinated customers to dine in these settings, subject to group sizes of up to 2 pax

        **Note:** F&B establishments will need to check their SFA food shop license categories to determine which establishment-type they are e.g. SFA food shop (coffee shops/eating houses), SFA food shop (food courts), SFA food shop (canteens). This concession only applies to establishments with a SFA food shop license for coffeeshop, eating house or canteen **and** are not substantially enclosed by a permanent barrier.

        <sup>1</sup> Please refer to [MOH’s Post Vaccination Matters website](http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs/faqs---post-vaccination-matters){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more information.

        <sup>2</sup> Recovered individuals can obtain a PET Exemption Notice from any clinic offering ART or PCR testing services.  Refer to [go.gov.sg/swabproviders](https://go.gov.sg/swabproviders){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for the list of MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers.

        <sup>3</sup> Unvaccinated individuals aged 13 or above must have a valid negative ART or PCR result from an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider within the last 24 hours. Refer to [go.gov.sg/swabproviders](https://go.gov.sg/swabproviders){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for the list of MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers. Self-administered ART supervised by employer and self-administered ART results are not recognised for vaccination-differentiated SMMs.

    - title: My operating costs will increase due to the increased demand for takeaway containers. Can the Government help with costs?
      content: |
        To help mitigate costs, F&B establishments can encourage customers to bring their own takeaway containers. Some establishments have already started to do so by offering incentives such as a small discount.

    - title: What if we run out of takeaway containers?
      content: |
        Singapore has sufficient stock of takeaway containers. Supply chains are open and new stocks are continuing to arrive in Singapore. Local suppliers are also ramping up their production capabilities to prepare to meet the increased demand.

        We encourage everyone to bring their own clean containers when buying food. This will not only help to reduce the amount of waste generated but also ease the demand on disposable containers. In turn, establishments should allow patrons to use their own reusable containers.

    - title: Must a food delivery personnel wear a mask at all times?
      content: |
        Food delivery personnel must wear a mask at all times in the course of their work.

        The only two exceptions are when he/she is cycling to deliver food. A mask must be worn once he/she completes cycling.

    - title: Can work-related events continue to be held at F&B establishments?
      content: |
        Work-related events (both non customer-facing and customer-facing) can be held within the workplace premises and third-party venues. Prevailing guidelines for the respective event venues will apply.

        (i) Non customer-facing events (e.g. conferences, seminars):

          a.  Such events  are subject to a cap of 50 persons or a lower number, depending on venue capacity and safe distancing requirements.

          b.  Meals should not be the main feature. Employers should also avoid holding events over mealtimes as far as possible. Food and drinks should only be served if incidental to the work-related event (e.g. the meeting or conference extends over lunchtime). In addition, the food must be served in individual portions, and participants must be seated while consuming the food and drinks. Participants should minimise the time that they are unmasked while eating and drinking. 

          c.  Should F&B establishments hold such events using their own premises, at least one-metre spacing between individuals must be maintained at all times. 

          d.  For events organised by external parties (where the F&B premises now function as a third-party venue), groups of up to 5 persons with at least one-metre spacing between groups are permitted. 

          e.  Should meals be provided as part of the event and it involves any participants who is not an employee of, or who does not regularly deliver goods or services to the enterprise organising the event, then every participant is required to be fully vaccinated. 

        (ii) Customer-facing events (e.g. product launches, marketing events):

          a.  Such events organised by F&B establishments within their own F&B premises are subject to the maximum number of individuals that the venue may accommodate after safe distancing measures are adhered to.

          b.  Events organised by external parties (where the F&B premises now function as a third-party venue) are subject to a cap of 50 persons (excluding the F&B establishment’s service staff) or a lower number, depending on venue capacity and safe distancing requirements.

          c.  Event participants can be in groups of up to 5 persons, with at least one-metre spacing between groups.

          d.  Meals should not be the main feature. Event organisers should also avoid holding events over mealtimes as far as possible. Food or drinks should only be served if incidental to the work-related event (e.g. the meeting or product launch extends over lunchtime). In addition, the food must be served in individual portions, participants must be seated while consuming the food and drinks, and there should be no intermingling between the groups. Participants should minimise the time that they are unmasked while eating and drinking.

          e.  Should meals be provided as part of the event, and it involves any participants who is not an employee of, or who does not regularly deliver goods or services to the enterprise organising the event, then every participant is required to be fully vaccinated.

        Such events are not permitted at public and common areas such as mall atriums, public transport nodes, HDB estates and common corridors. 

    - title: Can F&B establishments apply for earlier vaccination for their frontline workers?
      content: |
        From 2 August, all Singaporeans, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass holders aged 18 years old and above have also been allowed to walk in to any of our 11 community vaccination centres offering the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine without a prior appointment.

        From 10 August 2021, to make it more convenient to get vaccinated, all Singaporeans, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass holders aged 12 years old and above who have yet to come forward for their first dose will be able to walk in to any of the 26 vaccination centres offering the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine without a prior appointment.

        It would be more expeditious for F&B staff who have yet to be vaccinated to walk in to any Vaccination Centre or Mobile Vaccination Site. Please refer to [https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs](https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for the location of the vaccination centres

    - title: How can I find out more about the national vaccination programme? What are the side effects of vaccination?

    - title: I am a big establishment with a lot of outlets and employees. Will there be an alternative to self-collecting the kits?
      content: |
        To facilitate the collection/delivery of test kits, F&B establishments should submit full details at [https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food](https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} as soon as possible. Establishments must consolidate the collection/delivery of kits to a single location for each UEN. Depending on the size of your workforce, the kits may be arranged as a delivery to your address instead.

    - title: How do I create an account on SRS to upload the employees’ swab test results?
      content: |
        For unregistered F&B establishments, please submit your details at [https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food](https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. This registration would facilitate the set-up of companies’ SRS accounts and arrange for the delivery or collection of ART kits.
        
        Enterprises with multiple outlets must consolidate their submission and submit a single Order Form for each UEN. Enterprises will be responsible for the dissemination of the test kits to their respective outlets. The Point-of-Contact<sup>4</sup> (POC) indicated in the form must be the employee who will be responsible for both self-collection of the test kits, and the uploading of FET results to the SRS account.

        After the creation of the SRS account, the POC will need to upload the particulars of their supervisors. With the successful upload of their particulars, supervisors will be able to submit test results through the unique company SRS link.

        <sup>4</sup> Establishments are also able to nominate an alternate POC, if they wish to do so.

    - title: How do I add entries for new supervisors/update supervisors’ details on the SRS? 
      content: |
        Once the company’s SRS account has been created, the POC may log into the account to upload supervisors’ details, as well as make edits subsequently. The upload of supervisors’ details would give them access to submit test results through the unique company SRS link. 
    
    - title: Is there a deadline for employers to key in the test results onto the SRS portal? 
      content: |
        Establishments are required to upload the results of the outlet workers’ swab tests to the SRS on the same day as the tests are taken (within 24 hours). 
        
        For Ag+ cases, the results must be submitted on the SRS within 30 mins from the time of the test.  

    - title: I understand that the F&B FET regime is mandatory from 15 July. I have received my ART test kits but am experiencing technical issues with the Swab Registration System (SRS) (e.g. unable to log into the system/ upload supervisors/ upload results). What should I do? Can I still continue to operate?
      content: |
        You can continue to operate. However, you should reach out to HPB’s SRS technical support at [AskSRS@hpb.gov.sg](mailto:AskSRS@hpb.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} or [+65 6876 5830](tel:+6568765830) if you are facing technical issues with the SRS. Once you have received your ART test kits, you should proceed with the testing of your staff and keep a record of the results. Once the SRS system issues have been resolved, you will need to upload these backdated results into the system. Subsequently, all “AG+” or “Double Invalid” test results will have to be uploaded onto SRS no later than 30 minutes after the ESSS for that specific staff is completed; whereas all other “AG-” test results needs to be logged onto SRS within 24 hours.

    - title: How and where should my employees submit their test results?
      content: |
        Enterprises are required to upload the test results obtained by their workers from the Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (ESSS) onto the Swab Registration System (SRS). More information on the upload of test results can be found at [www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/fast-easy-testing](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/fast-easy-testing){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. 

    - title: Can I create multiple company admin accounts using the same UEN?
      content: |
        Yes, multiple company accounts can be created under a single UEN. However, each account will need to have a unique email address. This email address cannot be used for another UEN as the email address is the unique identifier for log in to the SRS.
        
        You may submit your request to create multiple SRS company accounts under the same UEN at [https://go.gov.sg/srs-account-creation](https://go.gov.sg/srs-account-creation){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. We will only create up to 3 company HR accounts per UEN.  Enterprises without a UEN can indicate their NRIC in the UEN field instead. Please ensure that the UEN/NRIC indicated is accurate.

    - title: What are the latest measures that retail establishments and lifestyle-related services need to note?
      content: |
        Retail establishments and lifestyle-related services are to comply with the following:

        a.  Social gatherings are allowed to comprise up to 5 persons. In line with this, retail establishments are to ensure at least one-metre spacing between groups of customers (of up to 5 persons). Malls should also ensure that crowds do not gather at atriums or common spaces, and discourage the consumption of food and drinks at such spaces.

        b.  From 19 August 2021, the occupancy limit for malls and large standalone stores will be one person per 10 sqm of Gross Floor Area (GFA).

        c.  From 19 August 2021, the operating capacity of Commercial Family Entertainment Centres will be at a maximum of one person per 10 sqm of usable space or 50% operating capacity, whichever is lower.

        d.  Services and activities in higher-risk settings, which require masks to be removed, are allowed to resume in groups of up to 5 persons if customers are fully vaccinated. These include personal care services (e.g. facial treatments, make-up services and saunas), Food & Beverage (F&B) dine-in and indoor high-intensity/ mask-off sports services.

        e.  Since 15 July 2021, it has been mandatory for establishments providing personal care services (e.g. facial and nail services, spas/saunas, massage establishments, hairdressing, and make-up services) to place all employees on a regular Fast and Easy Testing (FET) regime using tests such as antigen rapid test (ART), regardless of their vaccination status.

          - From 13 September 2021, the frequency of the FET RRT has been increased to once every 7 days to allow for earlier detection and ringfencing of cases. 

          - This includes both part-time and full-time employees, as well as third-party contracted staff (e.g. cleaners) who work at the establishments. Business owners and store managers who work at the workplace must also undergo FET. Individuals who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection in the past 270 days are exempted from the FET Requirement. Establishments can refer to the following Gobusiness portal link for more details.

        From 1 October 2021, all unvaccinated individuals working at establishments providing personal care services have to undergo testing twice a week using ART to mitigate risk of transmission to the public, under the  “Vaccinate or Regular Test” (VoRT) regime. This is now applicable to those working in malls, large standalone stores and supermarket outlets. The tests can be similarly done through employer-led supervised self-swabs.

        - The costs of testing required for unvaccinated employees are to be fully borne by users or their employers.

        - The government will subsidise tests for the small group of individuals who are medically ineligible for vaccines. 

        -	Note that all vaccinated employees working at establishments providing personal care services must continue with the prevailing FET regime (testing once every 14 days). 

        -	Employers may wish to refer to [MOM's Advisory on COVID-19 vaccination in employment settings](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. 

    - title: How can supermarket manage queues now that the measures may result in more people buying groceries to cook at home?
      content: |
        Supermarket retailers should implement other crowd management measures (e.g. limiting the number of shoppers within the store at any one time) to ensure that one metre spacing can be maintained between shoppers. They would also need to limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 5 persons, as well as maintain orderly queues in-store, and at entrance to store.

        Supermarkets are also encouraged to provide dedicated shopping hours for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and pregnant women. This can help to reduce intermingling to better protect those who are more vulnerable to COVID-19.

    - title: Are game arcades permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Yes, they can remain open. However, operators must practise safe management and safe distancing measures. They must ensure that common touchpoints are disinfected frequently.

    - title: Are playgrounds/ indoor playgrounds permitted to open? 
      content: |
        Common play areas for children/toddlers/infants in retail stores or malls can remain open. Operators of these play areas must ensure at least one-metre spacing between groups of customers.

    - title: Are personal care services permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Personal care services that require the removal of masks are allowed to resume if customers are fully vaccinated. These include beauty services and/or activities offered at retail outlets.

        Examples of such services include facial treatments, saunas, makeup services and portions of threading and facial grooming services, which require customers’ masks to be removed

    - title: Are massage/spa services permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Massage services are still allowed to operate within private rooms. However, customers will need to have their masks on at all times.

    - title: Are TCM patients allowed to take off their masks during their consultation?

    - title: Will vaccines other than Moderna/Pfizer be recognised for VDS?
      content: |
        PSAR approved vaccines (i.e. Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna vaccines currently administered under the National Vaccination Programme), as well as vaccines on the World Health Organisation’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) (such as Sinovac-CoronaVac, Sinopharm, and AstraZeneca-SKBio, Serum Institute of India, Janssen) are recognised for VDS.
        
        Individuals who are vaccinated with WHO-EUL vaccines will be eligible for vaccination-differentiated SMMs only if their vaccination records have been captured in MOH’s National Immunisation Registry (NIR).

    - title: Do I have to check the vaccination status for customers doing takeaways?
      content: |
        There is no need to conduct VDS checks for customers doing takeaways. However, it is your responsibility to ensure that these customers do not consume food and drinks on premise. There should be clearly demarcated waiting areas for customers doing takeaways.

    - title: For VDS, I understand that the children in the group must be from the same household. What about the other individuals in the group? Can we be from different households?
      content: |
        Yes, eligible individuals (13 years old and above) in the group can be from different households; they need not be from the same household as the children. Within the group, only children (12 and under) need to be from the same household. 

    - title: My F&B establishment is an alfresco dine in concept and naturally ventilated just like hawker centres and coffee shops. Can I allow 2 pax to dine in without checking VDS eligibility?
      content: |
        No, you are not allowed to do so. The 2 pax dine-in (regardless of vaccination status) only applies to hawker centres and coffee shops, which generally refer to F&B establishments that hold an SFA coffee shop/ eating house/ canteen license. Hawker centres and coffee shops provide convenient and affordable food services within the community. As they are open-air and naturally ventilated spaces, a special concession is thus given to allow vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals to dine in these settings, but subject to a group size of up to 2 persons only. 

    - title: The capacity of my F&B establishment is small and cannot accommodate dine-in groups of 5 pax. Can I allow 2 pax to dine in without checking VDS eligibility?
      content: |
        No, you are not allowed to do so. Even if your F&B establishment can only accommodate tables for 2 pax, you are required to implement VDS. Alternatively, you may choose to do only takeaway services.

    - title: My shop offers hairdressing/manicure/pedicure services, and is considered part of the personal care services sector. Do I also need to implement VDS?
      content: |
        No, you do not need to. VDS is to be implemented for personal care services that require customers to remove their masks for the duration of the service. For example, make-up services, facial treatments and saunas. 

    - title: Can I allow a foreign customer who received his/her PSAR-approved vaccines overseas and provides proof of this vaccination to dine in my F&B establishment/ partake in personal care services provided at my shop?

        Overseas vaccine certificates (hard or softcopy) will not be accepted for VDS. From 20 August 2021, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority will issue a tamper-proof vaccination sticker to be affixed onto the passport of newly-arrived travellers or Short-Term Visitor Pass Holders who were fully vaccinated overseas with a WHO-Emergency Use Listing vaccine, and who can furnish a valid English-language vaccination certificate. By September, the systems will also be enhanced so that travellers, upon verification of their eligible vaccination status at entry, will also be recognised by the SE Biz App through their TraceTogether Apps/Tokens to be eligible for VDS without needing to go through PET.

        In the meantime, short-term visitors/ tourists who had entered into Singapore before 20 August 2021 can show their valid negative PET results from MOH-approved test providers to be accepted for VDS.

    - title: Why are overseas vaccination certificates not recognised for VDS?
      content: |
        Overseas vaccine certificates (hard or softcopy) will not be accepted for VDS because it is difficult for individual establishments to verify the authenticity of these certificates which are issued in different formats and languages.

    - title: Will the government pay for FET for employees who are/cannot be vaccinated? What about those who are not fully-vaccinated yet (i.e. first dose only)?
      content: |
        The FET regime is mandatory for employees who interact with customers in higher-risk mask-off settings. ART kits will be provided for Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (ESSS) and the costs for these kits and training for employees will be borne by the government until 31 December 2021.

        From 1 October 2021, employees working in such sectors are to be fully vaccinated or have to undergo regular, twice-weekly testing. The government will subsidise the cost of tests for individuals who are medically ineligible for vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme. Enterprises should submit a consolidated declaration of their workers’ vaccination status at [https://go.gov.sg/mi-declaration](https://go.gov.sg/mi-declaration){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Please submit a consolidated entry for your UEN. 

    - title: Should F&B/spa/gym staff who are unvaccinated be redeployed to other roles? How is the government protecting the jobs of unvaccinated staff affected by this policy (‘vaccinate or regular test’) and prevent employers from displacing/letting them go?
      content: |
        The Vaccinate or Regular Testing (VoRT) regime is mandatory for employees in identified [settings](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-a2c38c82f53d24bd3a1374f87f22b1270.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} due to the high interaction with customers in these roles.  To safeguard the health of unvaccinated staff, employers can choose to redeploy staff who are unvaccinated to alternative positions in settings that are not on the mandatory testing regime.

    - title: Can I ask my employees to declare their vaccination status to me?
      content: |
        Employers may ask employees for their vaccination status for business purposes e.g. business continuity planning. Employees who decline to be vaccinated should not be penalised such as having their employment terminated on the ground of declining vaccination. 
        
        For the purpose of the VoRT regime, employees who decline or are unable to produce the proofs of vaccination will be regarded as unvaccinated but medically eligible and will be required to undergo twice-weekly testing.
