    - title: These additional measures have impacted my business greatly. How is the Government supporting us?
      content: |
        (i)	Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for affected sectors<br>
        The government will enhance the JSS support to 25% for the period of 27 September 2021 through 24 October 2021 for sectors significantly affected by the tightened measures. These sectors include F&B and retail. Please refer to the [annex](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex-b-mtf-18-jun.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details. 

        (ii)	Support to hawkers who are self-employed <br>
        Cooked food and market stallholders in centres managed by the NEA or NEA-appointed operators will receive a 2-week rental waiver. 

        (iii)	E-commerce Booster Package<br>
        ESG reintroduced support measure to help affected retail businesses diversify their revenue channels and defray business costs of going online:<br>
        - The E-Commerce Booster Package provides up to 80% support for local retailers to get on-board local e-commerce platforms, and will be available from 16 May 2021 to 16 November 2021.

        <u>Rental Support Scheme</u><br>
        The Government will provide a 2-week rental waiver for qualifying tenants on Government-owned commercial properties. Qualifying tenant-occupiers and owner-occupiers of privately-owned commercial properties will also be given a 2-week rental relief cash payout under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS). These will offset rent for half the duration of the Stabilisation Phase. More details on the RSS are available from the IRAS website.

    - title: Will there be updates on the GoBusiness portal for businesses, e.g. what are the permissible activities?
      content: |
        Please refer to the Safe Management Measures and guidelines stipulated in the sector-specific advisories on the GoBusiness portal.

    - title: Am I allowed to operate at full capacity during this time?  Or must we limit work to specific hours or at certain manpower limits?
      content: |
        Employers must ensure that all employees whose job functions can be performed from home should work from home. For those that are unable to work from home, employers should stagger start times and allow flexible workplace hours. Employees should not be cross deployed to other worksites. 

        Special attention should be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. older workers, pregnant workers, and those with underlying medical conditions) to enable them to work from home. For these employees, you could consider temporarily redeploying them to another role within the company so that they are able to telecommute or work from home. 

    - title: Do I need to send my staff for regular testing? 
      content: |
        All employees who work at settings with unmasked clients/patron, or where there is prolonged contact between individuals, are required to be placed on a regular Fast and Easy Tests Rostered Routine Testing (FET RRT) regime using tests such as antigen rapid tests (ART), regardless of vaccination status. These include: 

        a.  All individuals working at F&B establishments providing dine-in services;

        b.  All last-mile food delivery personnel;

        c.  Personal care services (e.g. nail services, massage establishments, hairdressing);

        d.  Gyms and fitness studios where clients are unmasked;

        e.	<u>All individuals working in malls, large standalone stores and supermarket outlets<sup>1</sup></u>
        
        The above include part-time and full-time employees, third-party contracted staff, and all other workers who <u>work on the premises</u>, e.g. cleaners, contractors, subcontractors, promoters).

        The regular FET for staff in these settings is mandatory. The frequency of the FET is once every 7 days to facilitate the earlier detection of cases.

        <sup>1</sup> This refers to all mall management employees as well as all tenants and vendors who work in the malls, large standalone stores and supermarkets, including those working in office spaces of the shops.

    - title: Why do I need to send my staff for regular testing?
      content: |
        Identified settings are of higher risk, as clients/patrons are unmasked while in close proximity to one another for prolonged periods of time. Employees who work at these settings would therefore need to undergo a 7-day regular FET with effect from 13 September 2021.

    - title: What is the cost of getting the antigen rapid tests (ART)?
      content: |
        For establishments that are placed on mandatory Fast and Easy Tests (FET) regime, the costs for the ART kits and training programmes for employees will be borne by the Government, until 31 December 2021. 

        For those who wish to purchase the ART kits, they are available at all major pharmacies in Singapore.

    - title: How do I organise/conduct mandatory testing for my employees?
      content: |
        The mandatory Fast and Easy Testing (FET) and Vaccinate or Regular Testing (VoRT) regimes for all establishments will be conducted via Employer-Supervised Self Swab (ESSS) where employees will swab themselves under the supervision of a trained staff (‘supervisor’). Supervision can be done either in-person or virtually.

        To support establishments in implementing the ESSS testing regime, cost for the supervisor’s training will be paid by the government until 31 December 2021. Enterprises must send 1 or 2 supervisors per outlet to undergo the training session to be qualified to supervise the employees’ self-swab.  

        Please refer to [https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/covid-19/fast-and-easy-testing](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/covid-19/fast-and-easy-testing){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more information on FET. 

    - title: I own a small business and am unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on my own. What should I do?
      content: |
        We encourage all businesses with at least 2 staff to conduct employer supervised self-swabs for their employees. 
        
        However, for small businesses (e.g. hawkers or establishments with only 1 employee) who are unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on their own, the government will set up Quick Test Centres (QTCs) to support those who need to be tested. 

        Businesses can refer to SFA's guide for onboarding for testing at Quick Test Centres (QTCs) instead [https://www.sfa.gov.sg/covid-19/mandatory-fast-and-easy-testing-(fet)-regime-for-all-outlet-employees-at-dine-in-f-b-establishments](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/covid-19/mandatory-fast-and-easy-testing-(fet)-regime-for-all-outlet-employees-at-dine-in-f-b-establishments){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

        -	Dine-in is not allowed if any individual does not meet the eligibility criteria above. Allowing this would be an offence.

          Children aged 12 years and below who are unvaccinated are eligible for vaccination-differentiated SMMs and may be included in the group of up to 2 persons. F&B establishments are to ensure that there is no mixing or mingling between different groups.   

        <u>Hawker centres/ coffee shops/ canteens<sup>4</sup></u>
        -	A special concession will be given to allow vaccinated and unvaccinated customers to dine in these settings, subject to a group size of up to 2 pax.

        **Note**: F&B establishments will need to check their SFA food shop license categories to determine which establishment-type they are e.g. SFA food shop (coffee shops/eating houses), SFA food shop (food courts), SFA food shop (canteens). 

        <sup>2</sup> Please refer to [MOH’s Post Vaccination Matters website](http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs/faqs---post-vaccination-matters){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more information.<br>

    - title: Must a food delivery personnel wear a mask at all times?
      content: |
        Food delivery personnel must wear a mask at all times in the course of their work.

        The only two exceptions are when he/she is cycling to deliver food. A mask must be worn once he/she completes cycling.

    - title: Can work-related events continue to be held at F&B establishments?
      content: |
        Work-related events (both non customer-facing and customer-facing) can be held within the workplace premises and third-party venues. Prevailing guidelines for the respective event venues will apply.

        (i) Non customer-facing events (e.g. conferences, seminars):

          * Meals should not be the main feature of the event. Employers should also avoid holding events over mealtimes as far as possible. Food and drinks should only be served if incidental to the work-related event (e.g. the meeting or conference extends over lunchtime). In addition, the food must be served in individual portions, and participants must be seated while consuming the food and drinks. Participants should minimise the time that they are unmasked while eating and drinking.

          * Should meals be provided as part of the event and it involves any participants who is not an employee of, or who does not regularly deliver goods or services to the enterprise organising the event, then every participant is required to be fully vaccinated. 

          * Such events held in F&B establishments are subject to a cap of 50 persons or a lower number, depending on venue capacity and safe distancing requirements.

          * Should F&B establishments hold such events using their own premises, at least one-metre spacing between individuals must be maintained at all times. 

          * For events organised by external parties (where the F&B premises now function as a third-party venue), groups of up to 2 persons with at least one-metre spacing between groups are permitted. 

        (ii) Customer-facing events (e.g. product launches, marketing events):

          * Meals should not be the main feature of the event. Event organisers should also avoid holding events over mealtimes as far as possible. Food or drinks should only be served if incidental to the work-related event (e.g. the meeting or product launch extends over lunchtime). In addition, the food must be served in individual portions, participants must be seated while consuming the food and drinks, and there should be no intermingling between the groups. Participants should minimise the time that they are unmasked while eating and drinking.

          * Should meals be provided as part of the event, and it involves any participants who is not an employee of, or who does not regularly deliver goods or services to the enterprise organising the event, then every participant is required to be fully vaccinated.

          * Such events organised by F&B establishments within their own F&B premises are subject to the maximum number of individuals that the venue may accommodate after safe distancing measures are adhered to.

          * Events organised by external parties (where the F&B premises now function as a third-party venue) are subject to a cap of 50 persons (excluding the F&B establishment’s service staff) or up to the venue capacity with safe distancing requirements in place, whichever is lower.

          * Event participants can be in groups of up to 2 persons, with at least one-metre spacing between groups. 

        Such events are not permitted at public and common areas such as mall atriums, public transport nodes, HDB estates and common corridors. 

    - title: I am having my wedding reception. Will I be able to have a food tasting session ahead of the reception in tables of 5?
      content: |
        No, the exception is only given for wedding receptions. Food tasting sessions ahead of the reception must comply with the existing F&B regulations. F&B establishments should not accept reservations or walk-ins, or allow in their premises social gatherings with more than 2 persons, even if they are split across multiple tables, food tasting sessions involving more than 2 persons must not be organised.

    - title: I am a big establishment with a lot of outlets and employees. Will there be an alternative to self-collecting the kits?
      content: |
        To facilitate the collection/delivery of test kits, F&B establishments should submit full details at [https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food](https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} as soon as possible. Establishments must consolidate the collection/delivery of kits to a single location for each UEN. Depending on the size of your workforce, the kits may be arranged as a delivery to your address instead.

    - title: How do I create an account on SRS to upload the employees’ swab test results?
      content: |
        For unregistered F&B establishments, please submit your details at [https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food](https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. This registration would facilitate the set-up of companies’ SRS accounts and arrange for the delivery or collection of ART kits.
        
        Enterprises with multiple outlets must consolidate their submission and submit a single Order Form for each UEN. Enterprises will be responsible for the dissemination of the test kits to their respective outlets. The Point-of-Contact<sup>5</sup> (POC) indicated in the form must be the employee who will be responsible for both self-collection of the test kits, and the uploading of FET results to the SRS account.

        After the creation of the SRS account, the POC will need to upload the particulars of their supervisors. With the successful upload of their particulars, supervisors will be able to submit test results through the unique company SRS link.

        <sup>5</sup> Establishments are also able to nominate an alternate POC, if they wish to do so.

    - title: How do I add entries for new supervisors/update supervisors’ details on the SRS? 
      content: |
        Once the company’s SRS account has been created, the POC may log into the account to upload supervisors’ details, as well as make edits subsequently. The upload of supervisors’ details would give them access to submit test results through the unique company SRS link. 
    
    - title: Is there a deadline for employers to key in the test results onto the SRS portal? 
      content: |
        Establishments are required to upload the results of the outlet workers’ swab tests to the SRS on the same day as the tests are taken (within 24 hours). 
        
        For Ag+ cases, the results must be submitted on the SRS within 30 mins from the time of the test.  

    - title: I understand that the F&B FET regime is mandatory from 15 July. I have received my ART test kits but am experiencing technical issues with the Swab Registration System (SRS) (e.g. unable to log into the system/ upload supervisors/ upload results). What should I do? Can I still continue to operate?
      content: |
        You can continue to operate. However, you should reach out to HPB’s SRS technical support at [AskSRS@hpb.gov.sg](mailto:AskSRS@hpb.gov.sg) or [+65 6876 5830](tel:+65 6876 5830) if you are facing technical issues with the SRS. Once you have received your ART test kits, you should proceed with the testing of your staff and keep a record of the results. Once the SRS system issues have been resolved, you will need to upload these backdated results into the system.

    - title: What are the latest measures that retail establishments and lifestyle-related services need to note?
      content: |
        Retail establishments and lifestyle-related services are to comply with the following:

        a.	Social gatherings are allowed to comprise up to 2 persons. In line with this, retail establishments are to ensure at least one-metre spacing between groups of customers (of up to 2 persons). Malls should also ensure that crowds do not gather at atriums or common spaces, and discourage the consumption of food and drinks at such spaces.

        b.	The occupancy limit for malls and large standalone stores will be one person per10 sqm of Gross Floor Area (GFA). 

        c.	The operating capacity of Commercial Family Entertainment Centres will be at a maximum of one person per 10 sqm of usable space or 50% operating capacity, whichever is lower. 

        d.	Services and activities in higher-risk settings, which require masks to be removed, are allowed to resume in groups of up to 2 persons if customers are fully vaccinated. These include personal care services (e.g. facial treatments, make-up services and saunas), Food & Beverage (F&B) dine-in and indoor high-intensity/ mask-off sports services. 

        e.	It is mandatory for establishments providing personal care services (e.g. facial and nail services, spas/saunas, massage establishments, hairdressing, and make-up services) to place all employees on a regular Fast and Easy Testing Rostered Routine Testing (FET RRT) regime using tests such as antigen rapid test (ART), regardless of their vaccination status. 

          *	The frequency of the FET RRT is now once every 7 days to allow for earlier detection and ringfencing of cases. 

          * By 27 September 2021, all individuals working in malls, large standalone stores and supermarket outlets must also undergo testing once every 7 days under the FET RRT regime.  

          *	This includes both part-time and full-time employees, as well as third-party contracted staff and all those who work on the premises (e.g. cleaners, promoters). Business owners and store managers who work at the workplace must also undergo FET. Individuals who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection in the past 270 days are exempted from the FET Requirement. Establishments can refer to the following Gobusiness portal link for more details.  
          
          * From 1 October 2021, all unvaccinated individuals working at establishments providing personal care services have to undergo testing twice a week using ART to mitigate risk of transmission to the public, under the “Vaccinate or Regular Test” (VoRT) regime. This is also applicable to those working in malls, large standalone stores and supermarket outlets. The tests can be similarly done through employer-led supervised self-swabs.   A test done under the existing FET RRT, which is a supervised FET, also counts towards this requirement. 

          *	The costs of additional testing required for unvaccinated employees are to be fully borne by users or the enterprises.

          *	The government will subsidise tests for individuals who are medically ineligible for vaccines.

          *	All vaccinated employees working at establishments providing personal care services must continue with the prevailing FET RRT regime (testing once every 7 days). 

          *	Employers may wish to refer to [MOM's Advisory on COVID-19 vaccination in employment settings](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

    - title: How can supermarket manage queues now that the measures may result in more people buying groceries to cook at home?
      content: |
        Supermarket retailers should implement other crowd management measures (e.g. limiting the number of shoppers within the store at any one time) to ensure that one metre spacing can be maintained between shoppers. They would also need to limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 2 persons, as well as maintain orderly queues in-store, and at entrance to store.

        Supermarkets are also encouraged to provide dedicated shopping hours for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and pregnant women. This can help to reduce intermingling to better protect those who are more vulnerable to COVID-19.

    - title: Are game arcades permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Yes, they can remain open. However, operators must practise safe management and safe distancing measures. They must ensure that common touchpoints are disinfected frequently.

    - title: Are playgrounds/ indoor playgrounds permitted to open? 
      content: |
        Common play areas for children/toddlers/infants in retail stores or malls can remain open. Operators of these play areas must ensure at least one-metre spacing between groups of customers.

    - title: Are personal care services permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Personal care services that require the removal of masks are allowed to resume if customers are fully vaccinated. These include beauty services and/or activities offered at retail outlets.

        Examples of such services include facial treatments, saunas, makeup services and portions of threading and facial grooming services, which require customers’ masks to be removed

    - title: Are massage/spa services permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Massage services are still allowed to operate within private rooms. However, customers will need to have their masks on at all times.

    - title: Are TCM patients allowed to take off their masks during their consultation?

    - title: Will vaccines other than Moderna/Pfizer be recognised for VDS?
      content: |
        PSAR approved vaccines (i.e. Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna vaccines currently administered under the National Vaccination Programme), as well as vaccines on the World Health Organisation’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) (such as Sinovac-CoronaVac, Sinopharm, and AstraZeneca-SKBio, Serum Institute of India, Janssen) are recognised for VDS.
        
        Please refer to MOH’s information sheet for more details of the requirements on VDS at [https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo](https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. 

    - title: Do I have to check the vaccination status for customers doing takeaways?
      content: |
        There is no need to conduct VDS checks for customers doing takeaways. However, it is your responsibility to ensure that these customers do not consume food and drinks on premise. There should be clearly demarcated waiting areas for customers doing takeaways.

    - title: Do I need to do SafeEntry at my F&B establishment? 
      content: |
        TraceTogether-only SafeEntry must be implemented for all dine-in customers and visitors at F&B establishments, including at food courts. Delivery personnel picking up food orders and take-away customers are not required to do SafeEntry as their presence at the F&B establishment is transient.  

        All establishments must require their employees and vendors to do SafeEntry check-in via TT-only SE. 

    - title: For VDS, I understand that the children in the group must be from the same household. What about the other individuals in the group? Can we be from different households?
      content: |
        Yes, eligible individuals (13 years old and above) in the group can be from different households; they need not be from the same household as the children. Within the group, only children (12 and under) need to be from the same household. 

    - title: My F&B establishment is an alfresco dine in concept and naturally ventilated just like hawker centres and coffee shops. Can I allow 2 pax to dine in without checking VDS eligibility?
      content: |
        No, you are not allowed to do so. The 2 pax dine-in (regardless of vaccination status) only applies to hawker centres and coffee shops, which generally refer to F&B establishments that hold an SFA coffee shop/ eating house/ canteen license that are not substantially enclosed by a permanent barrier. Hawker centres and coffee shops provide convenient and affordable food services within the community. As they are open-air and naturally ventilated spaces, a special concession is thus given to allow an unvaccinated individual to dine in these settings.  

    - title: My shop offers hairdressing/manicure/pedicure services, and is considered part of the personal care services sector. Do I also need to implement VDS?
      content: |
        No, you do not need to. VDS is to be implemented for personal care services that require customers to remove their masks for the duration of the service. For example, make-up services, facial treatments and saunas. 

    - title: Can I allow a foreign customer who received his/her PSAR-approved vaccines overseas and provides proof of this vaccination to dine in my F&B establishment/ partake in personal care services provided at my shop?
      content: |
        Overseas vaccine certificates (hard or softcopy) will not be accepted for VDS. From 20 August 2021, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority will issue a tamper-proof vaccination sticker to be affixed onto the passport of newly-arrived travellers or Short-Term Visitor Pass Holders who were fully vaccinated with a WHO-Emergency Use Listing vaccine, and who can furnish a valid English-language vaccination certificate. This sticker would be valid until the end of their STVP validity or until 30 September 2021, 2359hrs, whichever is earlier. From 6 September, the systems will also be enhanced so that travellers, upon verification of their eligible vaccination status at entry, will also be recognised by the SE Biz App through their TraceTogether Apps/Tokens to be eligible for VDS without needing to go through PET.

    - title: Why are overseas vaccination certificates not recognised for VDS?
      content: |
        Overseas vaccine certificates (hard or softcopy) will not be accepted for VDS because it is difficult for individual establishments to verify the authenticity of these certificates which are issued in different formats and languages.

    - title: Will the government pay for FET for employees who are/cannot be vaccinated? What about those who are not fully-vaccinated yet (i.e. first dose only)?
      content: |
        The FET regime is mandatory for employees who interact with customers in higher-risk mask-off settings, regardless of vaccination status. As such, ART kits will be provided for Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (ESSS) and the costs for these kits and training for the swab supervisors will be borne by the government until 31 December 2021.

        From 1 October 2021, employees working in selected sectors (including F&B) are also mandated to be fully vaccinated or have to undergo regular, twice-weekly testing. The government will subsidise the cost of tests for unvaccinated individuals who are medically ineligible for vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme. Enterprises should submit a consolidated declaration of their workers’ vaccination status at [https://go.gov.sg/mi-declaration](https://go.gov.sg/mi-declaration){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for your UEN.

    - title: Should F&B/spa/gym staff who are unvaccinated be redeployed to other roles? How is the government protecting the jobs of unvaccinated staff affected by this policy (‘vaccinate or regular test’) and prevent employers from displacing/letting them go?
      content: |
        While employers may continue to deploy unvaccinated employees in higher risk activities with regular testing, they can also decide whether to redeploy these employees to another job with lower risk of COVID-19 infection, commensurate with the employee’s experience and skills, as per existing redeployment policies. If there are no such policies within the organisation, terms and conditions for redeployment should be mutually agreed between employers and employees. 

        Please refer to the [annex](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-a2c38c82f53d24bd3a1374f87f22b1270.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for the list of sectors subjected to the VoRT regime.

    - title: Can I ask my employees to declare their vaccination status to me?

        Employers may ask employees for their vaccination status for business purposes e.g. business continuity planning. Employees who decline to be vaccinated should not be penalised such as having their employment terminated on the ground of declining vaccination. 
        
        For the purpose of the VoRT regime, employees who decline or are unable to produce the proofs of vaccination will be regarded as unvaccinated but medically eligible and will be required to undergo twice-weekly testing.
