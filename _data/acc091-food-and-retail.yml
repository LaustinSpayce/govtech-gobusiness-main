    - title: How long will these measures last for?
      content: |
        Thes latest measures will take effect from 21 June 2021 till mid July 2021. However, this may be extended if the situation does not improve.

    - title: Why is there a need for the Government to further calibrate F&B and other Retail operations?
      content: |
        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation. Due to the persistence of some undetected community transmission cases, we will need to calibrate our reopening plans. 

    - title: These additional measures have impacted my business greatly. How is the Government supporting us?
      content: |
        (i)	<u>Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for affected sectors</u>
        In view of the continued tightened safe management measures of various activities until mid-July 2021, the Government will extend the current enhancements to the JSS for affected sectors by 3 weeks (starting 21 June) before tapering it down to 10% for the subsequent 2 weeks. Please refer to the annex for more details. 

        (ii)  <u>Support to hawkers who are self-employed</u>
        To support hawkers and coffeeshop stallholders who are self-employed, the Government will extend the subsidies for fees for table-cleaning and centralized dishwashing services, and will provide rental waivers, till mid-July 2021 for stallholders in centres managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators. 

        (iii) <u>Food Delivery Booster Package and E-commerce Booster Package</u> 
        ESG reintroduced support measures to help affected F&B and retail businesses diversify their revenue channels and defray business costs of going online:

        - The E-Commerce Booster Package provides up to 80% support for local retailers to get on-board local e-commerce platforms, and will be available from 16 May 2021 to 16 November 2021.

    - title: Will there be updates on the GoBusiness portal for businesses, e.g. what are the permissible activities?
      content: |
        Please refer to the Safe Management Measures and guidelines stipulated in the sector-specific advisories on the GoBusiness portal.

    - title: Am I allowed to operate at full capacity during this time?  Or must we limit work to specific hours or at certain manpower limits?
      content: |
        Employers must ensure that all employees who are able to work from home do so. For those that are unable to work from home, employers should stagger start times and allow flexible workplace hours. Employees should not be cross deployed to other worksites. 

        Special attention should be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. older workers, pregnant workers, and those with underlying medical conditions) to enable them to work from home. For these employees, you could consider temporarily redeploying them to another role within the company so that they are able to telecommute or work from home.

    - title: Is there a minimum percentage or number of workers that employers must place on work-from-home-arrangements?
      content: |
        The objective of the requirements is to reduce physical interactions in the workplace in order to minimise spread of COVID-19. Employers should focus on providing the facilities necessary and directing every worker to work from home, as far as reasonably practicable. The proportion of employees that can do so will vary in different workplaces and sectors due to differing operational requirements. 

        The onus is on employers to show that they have made a reasonable effort to facilitate working from home, including reviewing and transforming business processes through technology to support remote working e.g. e-payment, e-invoicing, e-signatures. In this regard, you may refer to MOM’s [list of resources](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-a-resources-to-assist-companies.pdf?la=en&hash=A49779E587B330C7702C3A4B33401D85){:target="_blank"} that include technology solutions and grants available to assist companies.

    - title: Are companies that are operating required to ensure that their employees work from home?
      content: |
        It remains essential that we continue to keep transmission risks in check by reducing overall footfall and interactions at common spaces or near the workplace, and in public places. Therefore, work-from-home is the default mode of work and employers must provide the necessary facilities and direct their employees to work from home wherever possible.  

        Work-from-home measures should be implemented in a sustainable manner that enables employees to maintain work-life harmony while continuing to meet business needs. The [tripartite advisory on mental well-being at workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/tripartite-advisory-on-mental-well-being-at-workplaces){:target="_blank"} sets out practical guidance on measures that employers can adopt to support their employees’ mental well-being. 

        A list of resources such as technology solutions and grants available to assist companies is available [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-a-resources-to-assist-companies.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

        For employees who need to return to the workplace, employers should continue to stagger start times of these employees and implement flexible working hours. Social gatherings at the workplace will not be allowed. Employees may have meal breaks at the workplace, but refrain from intermingling with their colleagues when their masks are taken off.

    - title: Do I need to send my staff for regular testing? 
      content: |
        All employees who work at settings with unmasked clients/patron, or where there is prolonged contact between individuals, are required to be placed on a regular Fast and Easy Tests (FET) regime using tests such as antigen rapid tests (ART). These include staff of:

        a.  Dine-in F&B establishments; 
        b.  Personal care services (e.g. facial and nail services, spas/saunas, massage establishments, hairdressing, and make-up services); and
        c.  Gyms and fitness studios where clients are unmasked.
        
        The mandatory regular 14-day FET for staff at these settings will be progressively rolled out from 21 June 2021 and made mandatory from mid-July 2021. 

    - title: Why do I need to send my staff for regular testing? 
      content: |
        Identified settings are of higher risks, as clients/patrons are unmasked while in close proximity to one another for prolonged periods of time. Employees who work at these settings would therefore need to undergo 14-day regular FET.

    - title: What is the cost of getting the antigen rapid tests (ART)?
      content: |
        For establishments that are required to be placed on mandatory Fast and Easy Tests (FET) regime, the costs for the ART kits and training programmes for employees will be borne by the Government for the first 3 months, until 20 September 2021, during the initial roll-out.
        For those who wish to purchase the ART self-test kits, they are available at all major pharmacies in Singapore, and their retail prices range from $10 to $13 per test kit. 

    - title: How do I organise/conduct Fast and Easy Tests (FET) for my employees?
      content: |
        FET for all dine-in F&B establishments will be conducted via Employer-Supervised Self Swab (ESSS) where employees will swab themselves under the supervision of a trained staff (‘supervisor’). Supervision can be done either in-person or virtually.

        To support establishments in their efforts to get started on FET, the government has also set up training programmes that companies can leverage to train supervisors in their establishments to supervise ART self-swabs for their staff. These supervisor training programmes will be provided at no costs to these establishments for the next three months.    

        More details on the registration process and collection of kits will be announced. 

        For those who wish to purchase the ART self-test kits, they are available at all major pharmacies in Singapore, and their retail prices range from $10 to $13 per test kit. 

    - title: I own a small business and am unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on my own. What should I do? 
      content: |
        We encourage all businesses to conduct employer supervised self-swabs for their employees. 

        However, for small businesses (e.g. hawkers) who are unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on their own, the government will set up Quick Test Centres (QTCs) to support those who need to be tested. The first 2 QTCs at Tekka and Yishun will be operational from **21 June 2021**. More QTCs will be progressively set up. 

    - title: On the regular testing regime, is there a need to bring it to a shorter interval, instead of 14 days? 
      content: |
        The Government will monitor the situation closely and if the need arises, the frequency may be increased.

    - title: Can F&B establishments allow dine-in options?
      content: |
        From 21 June through mid-July 2021, F&B establishments are allowed to resume food service operations, with the exception of establishments with Pubs, Nightclubs, Discos and Karaoke SFA license categories or SSIC codes starting with 5613. They must comply with the following: 

        (i) F&B establishments are only permitted to seat dining groups of up to 2 persons. F&B establishments must also ensure that a safe distance of at least one metre is maintained between groups of diners to mitigate the risk of transmission. This refers to the distance between the edges of every group (of up to 2 persons) or person. In addition, F&B establishments must ensure that the furniture is arranged in such a way to facilitate safe distancing between groups – for example, the distance measured between the backs of chairs used by diners in different groups, or the legs of chairs if there is no back, must also be at least one metre apart.

        (ii)  Sale and consumption of alcohol in all F&B establishments are prohibited after 2230hrs daily. This includes consumption at any outdoor refreshment area and/or tables/chairs owned or managed by such establishment. As a best practice, by around 2200hrs, F&B operators should cease the sale of alcohol as a dine-in service and remind customers to consume their alcohol by 2230hrs. 

        (iii) F&B establishments are not allowed to play any form of background music or sounds. 

        (iv)  F&B establishments may serve as venues for wedding solemnisations and/or work-related events by third parties and are required to comply with the SMMs for these events. Food and drinks are not allowed to be consumed at these events. Wedding receptions also remain prohibited.

        All F&B establishments are also to note and implement the following measures:   
        
        (i) Ventilate and improve the indoor air quality where possible.
        (ii)  F&B establishments should proactively manage potential contacts of COVID-19 cases at the workplace.
        (iii) Observe the protocol on disinfection for premises visited by positive COVID-19 cases.
        (iv)  F&B establishments providing dine-in services are to place all employees on a regular Fast and Easy Testing (FET) regime using tests such as antigen rapid test (ART), regardless of their vaccination status. Mandatory FET will be rolled out progressively for dine-in F&B establishments.

    - title: Can establishments with Pub/Bar/Nightclub/Disco (PBND) licenses continue to provide takeaway and delivery services?
      content: |
        Pivoted establishments with the requisite SFA F&B licenses, as well as bars on the nightlife pilot programme, are allowed to provide takeaway and delivery services. 

        Nightlife entities, which have either Pubs, Bars, Nightclubs, Discos and Karaoke SFA license categories or SSIC codes starting with 5613) are still not allowed to operate during this period.

    - title: My operating costs will increase due to the increased demand for takeaway containers. Can the Government help with costs?
      content: |
        To help mitigate costs, F&B establishments can encourage customers to bring their own takeaway containers. Some establishments have already started to do so by offering incentives such as a small discount.

    - title: What if we run out of takeaway containers?
      content: |
        Singapore has sufficient stock of takeaway containers. Supply chains are open and new stocks are continuing to arrive in Singapore. Local suppliers are also ramping up their production capabilities to prepare to meet the increased demand.

        We encourage everyone to bring their own clean containers when buying food. This will not only help to reduce the amount of waste generated but also ease the demand on disposable containers. In turn, establishments should allow patrons to use their own reusable containers.

    - title: Must a food delivery personnel wear a mask at all times?
      content: |
        Food delivery personnel must wear a mask at all times in the course of their work.

        The only two exceptions are when he/she is cycling to deliver food. A mask must be worn once he/she completes cycling.

    - title: Can work-related events continue to be held at F&B establishments?
      content: |
        Work-related events (both non customer-facing and customer-facing) can be held within the workplace premises and third-party venues. Prevailing guidelines for the respective event venues will apply.

        (i)	Non customer-facing events (e.g. conferences, seminars):

    - title: Can I have lunch with my family members (within the same household) in a group of more than 2 persons in an F&B establishment? 
      content: |
        As per prevailing F&B SMMs, each dining group must be limited to 2 persons, with at least one-metre spacing between groups. Gatherings or groups of more than 2 persons are not allowed, even if they are split across multiple tables*. There should be no mixing or intermingling between groups.

        *Exceptions can only be made if all persons in the group are from the same household. These group(s) can be allowed into the F&B establishment. However, they will need to be seated at multiple tables, with no more than 2 persons per table, and at least one metre between tables. There should also be no intermingling between the dining groups in the F&B establishment.

    - title: Are babies or toddlers included in the group size limits in F&B establishments?

    - title: What are the next steps after applying for earlier vaccination? How long will F&B frontline workers have to wait to be vaccinated? 
      content: |
        The Government recognises that staff of F&B dine-in establishments are involved in higher-risk activities and will facilitate earlier vaccination of individuals who work in these settings. Individuals will receive a SMS directly from MOH to book their appointment slots for vaccination, once there are available slots. We seek your understanding that SMSes will be sent progressively as vaccination appointment slots are made available as supplies arrive. Individuals are also encouraged to register under the national vaccination programme at http://www.vaccine.gov.sg if they are already in eligible age groups.

    - title: Is the earlier vaccination open to all F&B frontline workers, including foreigners?
      content: |
        All staff of F&B dine-in establishments are eligible for earlier vaccination, regardless of nationality. Interested F&B establishments can reach out to Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS) at enquiry@ras.org.sg for more details.

    - title: How can supermarket manage queues now that the tightening of measures may result in more people buying groceries to cook at home?
      content: |
        Supermarket retailers should implement other crowd management measures (e.g. limiting the number of shoppers within the store at any one time) to ensure that one metre spacing can be maintained between shoppers. They would also need to limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 5 persons, as well as maintain orderly queues in-store, and at entrance to store.

        Supermarkets are also encouraged to provide dedicated shopping hours for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and pregnant women. This can help to reduce intermingling to better protect those who are more vulnerable to COVID-19.

    - title: Are game arcades permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Yes, they can remain open.
