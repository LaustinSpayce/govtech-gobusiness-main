    - title: Is mask wearing mandatory in F&B establishments?
      content: |
        From 29 August 2022, the legal requirement for mask wearing in indoor settings will be removed, with the exception of indoor healthcare and residential care<sup>1</sup> as well as public transport<sup>2</sup> settings. 

        F&B establishments in these settings should ensure that customers and working personnel, including food delivery personnel, wear their masks when not eating or drinking.  

        Mask wearing in outdoor settings is optional. However, we encourage individuals to exercise precaution (for example, wear their masks in crowded outdoor areas). 

        Mask wearing required as part of sectoral regulations, such as the Singapore Food Agency's (SFA) requirement for food handlers, will continue to apply.

        All personnel engaged in the sale and preparation of food and drinks at all F&B establishments are required to wear a mask or spit guard<sup>3</sup>. This applies to those involved in the following:
        -	Processing, preparation of ingredients and/or cooking of food.
        -	Packing of cooked and/or Ready-to-Eat food/ Handling unsealed finished products (including wet market food stalls)
        -	Dishing of cooked and/or Ready-to-Eat food to consumers
        -	Preparation of drinks

        Personnel are not required to put on masks/ spit guards if they are only involved in the following:
        -	Bringing plated food to consumers
        -	Delivery of packed/ bento food to consumers (e.g. food delivery personnel)
        -	Cleaning activities (e.g. collection of used crockery/ utensils, washing or cleaning of dining tables)
        -	Collection of payment from customers

        Please refer to the [SFA's advisory](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/media-release-advisory-on-wearing-of-masks-or-spit-guards-by-food-handlers_24aug22.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details.

        <sup>1</sup> Indoor premises of hospitals and polyclinics (inclusive of retail, F&B outlets, common areas and other facilities within the hospital/polyclinic building); private primary care and dental facilities, specialist clinics, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinics, renal dialysis centres, clinical and radiological laboratories, day hospices; residential care homes; COVID-19 care facilities, testing centres and vaccination centres; as well as on emergency ambulances and medical transport vehicles.<br>
        <sup>2</sup> This covers the MRT/LRT and public buses, and indoor public transport facilities (e.g. boarding areas within bus interchanges and MRT platforms). Mask-wearing on private transport modes, as well as school buses, private bus services and taxis, will be optional.
        <sup>3</sup> Food handlers working in mask-on zones must wear masks and are not allowed to wear a spit guard.  

    - title: Do I need to conduct VDS checks in my F&B establishment? 
      content: |
        Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs (VDS) continue to apply for dining in at F&B establishments. However, F&B establishments no longer need to conduct VDS checks for their customers, which is already the case for hawker centres and coffee shops. <b>The onus will be on individuals dining in to abide by the rules.</b> 

        <b>F&B establishments should continue to inform customers that VDS is required for dining in</b>, e.g. by putting up notices on their premises informing customers that only customers who meet any of the following criteria may dine in:

        a.	Are fully vaccinated<sup>4</sup>; 

        b.	Have recovered from COVID-19<sup>5</sup>; or

        c.	Are unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in or after 2010); or

        d.	Are certified to be medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme. Medically ineligible individuals will need to show the 'vaccination exemption' status via the Trace-Together App/Token, HealthHub or present a hard copy memo<sup>6</sup> issued by a General Practitioner (GP) clinic, public or private healthcare institution, along with a government-issued photo identification card for entry into these premises. More details on the criteria for medical ineligibility can be found in the sample of the standard memo [here](https://go.gov.sg/acceptabledocs){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
        
        Random spot checks will be done by enforcement agencies to ensure that only fully vaccinated individuals are dining in at such establishments. 

        Refer to [MOH's information sheet](https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details of the requirements for VDS.

        <sup>4</sup> This means they must have received the appropriate regimen of [World Health Organisation Emergency Use Listing](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} (WHO EUL) vaccines. Those aged 12 and above who have completed the primary vaccination series would require a booster dose to maintain the vaccination status. For more information, refer to [MOH's information sheet on the requirements for VDS](https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.<br>  
        <sup>5</sup> Currently, all recovered persons from COVID-19 who are not fully vaccinated are given a 180-day exemption after infection to enter the F&B establishment for dine in. From 1 June 2022, all recovered persons will need to receive the booster dose within 9 months of their last primary vaccination dose, in order to maintain their vaccinated status.<br>
        <sup>6</sup> To be certified as medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme, individuals may visit a doctor familiar with their medical condition, or alternatively, any clinic or hospital to obtain a hardcopy doctor-certified memo.

          - They must also ensure that all personnel engaged in the sale and preparation of food and drinks wear masks or spit guards at all times.
          - Communal amenities for self-service (e.g. drink dispensers, cutlery and condiment stations) can be used.

          - They should frequently clean serving cutlery or replace them with cleaned ones.
          - F&B establishments should also continue to maintain high standards of food safety and comply with the existing food safety practices.

        <sup>7</sup> F&B establishments and caterers are required <b>to provide at least two bottles of hand sanitisers (containing at least 60% alcohol) or two packs of disposable gloves in the vicinity of a self-service buffet, with all starting points covered, regardless of where the self-service buffet is held.</b>
