    - title: These additional measures have impacted my business greatly. How is the Government supporting us?
      content: |
        (i)	Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for affected sectors
        In view of the continued tightened safe management measures of various activities until mid-July 2021, the Government will extend the current enhancements to the JSS for affected sectors by 3 weeks (starting 21 June) before tapering it down to 10% for the subsequent 2 weeks. Please refer to the [annex](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex-b-mtf-18-jun.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details. 

        (ii)	Support to hawkers who are self-employed 
        To support hawkers and coffeeshop stallholders who are self-employed, the Government will extend the subsidies for fees for table-cleaning and centralized dishwashing services, and will provide rental waivers, till mid-July 2021 for stallholders in centres managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators. 

        (iii)	Food Delivery Booster Package and E-commerce Booster Package 
        ESG reintroduced support measures to help affected F&B and retail businesses diversify their revenue channels and defray business costs of going online:

        (iv)	The Food Delivery Booster Package defrays part of food delivery costs, via food delivery platforms and third-party logistics partners, and will be available from 22 Jul to 18 Aug 2021.

        (v)	The E-Commerce Booster Package provides up to 80% support for local retailers to get on-board local e-commerce platforms, and will be available from 16 May 2021 to 16 November 2021.

        <u>Rental Support Scheme</u>
        Rental support for SME of Commercial Properties during two P2HA periods, disbursed by IRAS to qualifying tenants:
        - Half-month rental relief cash payout (payout from Aug 2021)
        - Half-month rental relief cash payout (payout from Oct 2021)

    - title: Will there be updates on the GoBusiness portal for businesses, e.g. what are the permissible activities?
      content: |
        Please refer to the Safe Management Measures and guidelines stipulated in the sector-specific advisories on the GoBusiness portal.

    - title: Am I allowed to operate at full capacity during this time?  Or must we limit work to specific hours or at certain manpower limits?
      content: |
        Employers must ensure that all employees who are able to work from home do so. For those that are unable to work from home, employers should stagger start times and allow flexible workplace hours. Employees should not be cross deployed to other worksites. 

        Special attention should be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. older workers, pregnant workers, and those with underlying medical conditions) to enable them to work from home. For these employees, you could consider temporarily redeploying them to another role within the company so that they are able to telecommute or work from home.

    - title: Is there a minimum percentage or number of workers that employers must place on work-from-home-arrangements?
      content: |
        The objective of the requirements is to reduce physical interactions in the workplace in order to minimise spread of COVID-19. Employers should focus on providing the facilities necessary and directing every worker to work from home, as far as reasonably practicable. The proportion of employees that can do so will vary in different workplaces and sectors due to differing operational requirements. 

        The onus is on employers to show that they have made a reasonable effort to facilitate working from home, including reviewing and transforming business processes through technology to support remote working e.g. e-payment, e-invoicing, e-signatures. In this regard, you may refer to MOM’s [list of resources](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-a-resources-to-assist-companies.pdf?la=en&hash=A49779E587B330C7702C3A4B33401D85){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} that include technology solutions and grants available to assist companies.

    - title: Are companies that are operating required to ensure that their employees work from home?
      content: |
        Work-from-home will continue to be the default at workplaces. Employers must provide the necessary facilities and direct their employees to work from home wherever possible.  

        Work-from-home measures should be implemented in a sustainable manner that enables employees to maintain work-life harmony while continuing to meet business needs. The [tripartite advisory on mental well-being at workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/tripartite-advisory-on-mental-well-being-at-workplaces){:rel="noopener"} sets out practical guidance on measures that employers can adopt to support their employees’ mental well-being. 

        A list of resources such as technology solutions and grants available to assist companies is available [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-a-resources-to-assist-companies.pdf){:rel="noopener"}. Enforcement checks will be conducted and actions will be taken against businesses for non-compliance. 

        For employees who need to return to the workplace, employers should continue to stagger start times of these employees and implement flexible working hours. Social gatherings at the workplace will not be allowed. Employees may have meal breaks at the workplace, but refrain from intermingling with their colleagues when their masks are taken off.

    - title: Do I need to send my staff for regular testing? 
      content: |
        All employees who work at settings with unmasked clients/patron, or where there is prolonged contact between individuals, are required to be placed on a regular Fast and Easy Tests (FET) regime using tests such as antigen rapid tests (ART). These include staff of: 

        a.  Dine-in F&B establishments; 
        b.  Personal care services (e.g. nail services, massage establishments, hairdressing); and
        c.  Gyms and fitness studios where clients are unmasked.

        The regular 14-day FET for staff at these settings is mandatory from 15 July 2021. 

    - title: Why do I need to send my staff for regular testing? 
      content: |
        Identified settings are of higher risks, as clients/patrons are unmasked while in close proximity to one another for prolonged periods of time. Employees who work at these settings would therefore need to undergo 14-day regular FET.

    - title: What is the cost of getting the antigen rapid tests (ART)?
      content: |
        For establishments that are placed on mandatory Fast and Easy Tests (FET) regime, the costs for the ART kits and training programmes for employees will be borne by the Government for the first 3 months, until 30 September 2021.

        For those who wish to purchase the ART self-test kits, they are available at all major pharmacies in Singapore, and their retail prices range from $10 to $13 per test kit.

    - title: How do I organise/conduct Fast and Easy Tests (FET) for my employees?
      content: |
        FET for all dine-in F&B establishments will be conducted via Employer-Supervised Self Swab (ESSS) where employees will swab themselves under the supervision of a trained staff (‘supervisor’). Supervision can be done either in-person or virtually.

        To support establishments in their efforts to get started on FET, the government has also set up training programmes that companies can leverage to train supervisors in their establishments to supervise ART self-swabs for their staff. These supervisor training programmes will be provided at no costs to these establishments for the next three months.    

        Please refer to [https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/covid-19/fast-and-easy-testing](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/covid-19/fast-and-easy-testing) for more information on FET. 

    - title: I own a small business and am unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on my own. What should I do?
      content: |
        We encourage all businesses with at least 2 staff to conduct employer supervised self-swabs for their employees. 
        
        However, for small businesses (e.g. hawkers or establishments with only 1 employee) who are unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on their own, the government will set up Quick Test Centres (QTCs) to support those who need to be tested. 

        Businesses can refer to SFA's guide for onboarding for testing at Quick Test Centres (QTCs) instead (https://www.sfa.gov.sg/covid-19/mandatory-fast-and-easy-testing-(fet)-regime-for-all-outlet-employees-at-dine-in-f-b-establishments). Please refer to the section on "How to onboard by Quick Test Centre?” on the steps required.

    - title: On the regular testing regime, is there a need to bring it to a shorter interval, instead of 14 days? 
      content: |
        The Government will monitor the situation closely and if the need arises, the frequency may be increased.

    - title: Can F&B establishments allow dine-in options?
      content: |
        From 10 Aug, F&B establishments are allowed to continue food service operations, with the exceptions of PBND SFA license categories or SSIC codes starting with 5613.

        F&B establishments including food courts are permitted to seat dine-in groups of up to 5 pax with vaccine differentiated SMMs (VDS) in place
        
        - VDS eligibility criteria are as follows:

          a.  Fully vaccinated (an individual is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after he or she has received the full regimen of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna vaccines currently administered under the National Vaccination Programme, or after completing the full regimen of vaccines on the World Health Organisation’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) including the appropriate duration post-vaccination for the vaccine to be fully effective); or 

          b.  Recovered from COVID-19 and can provide a valid Pre-Event Test (PET) exemption notice for the duration of his/her dine-in from an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider; or 

          c.  Has a valid negative PET result for the duration of his/her dine-in from an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider within the last 24 hours 

        - Children aged 12 years and below who do not meet the eligibility criteria may be included in the group of up to 5 persons. If there is more than one such child in the group, all children must be from the same household.

        Hawker centres/ coffee shops/ canteens

        - A special concession will be given to allow vaccinated and unvaccinated customers to dine in these settings, subject to group sizes of up to 2 pax

        **Note:** F&B establishments will need to check their SFA food shop license categories to determine which establishment-type they are e.g. SFA food shop (coffee shops/eating houses), SFA food shop (food courts), SFA food shop (canteens)

    - title: Can establishments with Pub/Bar/Nightclub/Disco (PBND) licenses continue to provide takeaway and delivery services? 
      content: |
        F&B establishments are allowed to continue food service operations, with the exception of establishments with Pubs, Bars, Nightclubs, Discos and Karaoke SFA license categories or SSIC codes starting with 5613.

    - title: My operating costs will increase due to the increased demand for takeaway containers. Can the Government help with costs?
      content: |
        To help mitigate costs, F&B establishments can encourage customers to bring their own takeaway containers. Some establishments have already started to do so by offering incentives such as a small discount.

    - title: What if we run out of takeaway containers?
      content: |
        Singapore has sufficient stock of takeaway containers. Supply chains are open and new stocks are continuing to arrive in Singapore. Local suppliers are also ramping up their production capabilities to prepare to meet the increased demand.

        We encourage everyone to bring their own clean containers when buying food. This will not only help to reduce the amount of waste generated but also ease the demand on disposable containers. In turn, establishments should allow patrons to use their own reusable containers.

    - title: Must a food delivery personnel wear a mask at all times?
      content: |
        Food delivery personnel must wear a mask at all times in the course of their work.

        The only two exceptions are when he/she is cycling to deliver food. A mask must be worn once he/she completes cycling.

    - title: Can work-related events continue to be held at F&B establishments?
      content: |
        Work-related events (both non customer-facing and customer-facing) can be held within the workplace premises and third-party venues. Prevailing guidelines for the respective event venues will apply.

        (i) Non customer-facing events (e.g. conferences, seminars):

          a.  Events held in F&B establishments are subject to a cap of 50 persons or a lower number, depending on venue capacity and safe distancing requirements.

          b.  At least one-metre spacing between individuals must be maintained at all times.

          c.  Food and drinks are not allowed. 

          d.  Prevailing SMMs as indicated in MOM’s Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the workplace continue to apply.

        (ii) Customer-facing events (e.g. product launches, marketing events):  

          a.  Events organised by F&B establishments within their own F&B premises are subject to the maximum number of individuals that the venue may accommodate after safe distancing measures are adhered to.

          b.  Events organised by external parties at F&B establishments (where the F&B premises now function as a third-party venue) are subject to a cap of 50 persons (excluding service staff) or a lower number, depending on venue capacity and safe distancing requirements.

          c.  Food and drinks are not allowed. 

          d.  Each group must be limited to a maximum of 5 persons, with at least one-metre spacing between groups.

          e.  Food fairs are not permitted.

          f.  All other prevailing workplace and venue SMMs must be adhered to.

        Such events are not permitted at public and common areas such as mall atriums, public transport nodes, HDB estates and common corridors.

    - title: Can F&B establishments apply for earlier vaccination for their frontline workers?
      content: |
        From 2 August, all Singaporeans, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass holders aged 18 years old and above have also been allowed to walk in to any of our 11 community vaccination centres offering the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine without a prior appointment.

        From 2 August, all Singaporeans, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass holders aged 18 years old and above have also been allowed to walk in to any of our 11 community vaccination centres offering the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine without a prior appointment.

        It would be more expeditious for F&B staff who have yet to be vaccinated to walk in to any Vaccination Centre or Mobile Vaccination Site. Please refer to [https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs](https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs){:target="_blank"}{rel="noopener"} for the location of the vaccination centres

    - title: I am a big establishment with a lot of outlets and employees. Will there be an alternative to self-collecting the kits? 
      content: |
        To facilitate the collection of test kits, F&B establishments should submit full details at [https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food](https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} by 5 July 2021. 
        
        For large establishments with multiple outlets and employ a large group of employees, the logistics partner will reach out to them separately on the arrangement for point-to-point delivery following the submission of the form. 

    - title: How do I create an account on SRS to upload the employees’ swab test results? 
      content: |
        F&B establishments must submit their details at [https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food](https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for the set-up of their SRS accounts. 
        
        Enterprises with multiple outlets are encouraged to submit a form for each outlet (or unique SFA license)<sup>2</sup>. The Point-of-Contact<sup>3</sup> (POC) indicated in the form must be the employee who will be responsible for both self-collection of the test kits, and the uploading of FET results to the SRS account.  

        After the creation of the SRS account, the POC will need to upload the particulars of their supervisors. With the successful upload of their particulars, supervisors will be able to submit test results through the unique company SRS link.

        <sup>2</sup> For businesses with multiple outlets under the same UEN, you may submit your request to create multiple SRS company accounts under the same UEN. However, there must be a unique mobile number and email address used for each account. F&B establishments without a UEN can indicate their NRIC in the UEN field instead.  
        <sup>3</sup> Establishments are also able to nominate an alternate POC per outlet, if they wish to do so.

    - title: When will the SRS be ready for upload of results?
      content: |
        The SRS is ready for companies to upload results. More details on the uploading of results to the SRS will be provided at www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/fast-easy-testing.
    
    - title: How do I add entries for new supervisors/update supervisors’ details on the SRS? 
      content: |
        Once the company’s SRS account has been created, the POC may log into the account to upload supervisors’ details, as well as make edits subsequently. The upload of supervisors’ details would give them access to submit test results through the unique company SRS link. 
    
    - title: Is there a deadline for employers to key in the test results onto the SRS portal? 
      content: |
        Establishments are required to upload the results of the outlet workers’ swab tests to the SRS on the same day as the tests are taken (within 24 hours). 
        
        For Ag+ cases, the results must be submitted on the SRS within 30 mins from the time of the test.  

    - title: I understand that the F&B FET regime is mandatory from 15 July. I have received my ART test kits but am experiencing technical issues with the Swab Registration System (SRS) (e.g. unable to log into the system/ upload supervisors/ upload results). What should I do? Can I still continue to operate?
      content: |
        You can continue to operate. However, if you have received your ART test kits, you should proceed with the testing of your staff and keep a record of the results. Once the SRS system issues have been resolved, you will need to upload these backdated results into the system. Subsequently, all “AG+” or “Double Invalid” test results will have to be uploaded onto SRS no later than 30 minutes after the ESSS for that specific staff is completed; whereas all other “AG-” test results needs to be logged onto SRS within 24 hours.

    - title: How and where should my employees submit their test results?
      content: |
        Enterprises are required to upload the test results obtained by their workers from the Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (ESSS) onto the Swab Registration System (SRS). More information on the upload of test results can be found at www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/fast-easy-testing. 

    - title: Can I create multiple company admin accounts using the same UEN?
      content: |
        Yes, multiple company accounts can be created under a single UEN. However, each account will need to have a unique email address. This email address cannot be used for another UEN as the email address is the unique identifier for log in to the SRS.

    - title: What are the latest measures that retail establishments and lifestyle-related services need to note?
      content: |
        From 10 August 2021, retail establishments and lifestyle-related services are to comply with the following: 

        a.  Social gatherings are allowed to comprise up to 5 persons. In line with this, retail establishments are to ensure at least one-metre spacing between groups of customers (of up to 5 persons). Malls should also ensure that crowds do not gather at atriums or common spaces, and discourage the consumption of food and drinks at such spaces.

        b.  The occupancy limit for malls and large standalone stores will be one person per 16 sqm of Gross Floor Area (GFA) until 18 August 2021. During this period, retail establishments should cancel all events and promotions that will result in crowding at their physical premises in a manner which is non-compliant with the SMMs. From 19 August 2021, if the COVID-19 situation remains under control, the occupancy limit will be increased to one person per 10 sqm of GFA.

        c.  The operating capacity of Commercial Family Entertainment Centres will remain at a maximum of one person per 16 sqm of usable space or 25% operating capacity, whichever is lower. From 19 August 2021, if the COVID-19 situation remains under control, the occupancy limit will be increased to one person per 10 sqm of GFA.

        d.  Services and activities in higher-risk settings, which require masks to be removed, are allowed to resume in groups of up to 5 persons if customers are fully vaccinated. These include personal care services (e.g. facial treatments, make-up services and saunas), Food & Beverage (F&B) dine-in and indoor high-intensity/ mask-off sports services. 

        e.  Since 15 July 2021, it has been mandatory for establishments providing personal care services (e.g. facial and nail services, spas/saunas, massage establishments, hairdressing, and make-up services) to place all employees on a regular Fast and Easy Testing (FET) regime using tests such as antigen rapid test (ART), regardless of their vaccination status. 

          - This includes both part-time and full-time employees, as well as third-party contracted staff (e.g. cleaners) who work at the establishments. Business owners and store managers who work at the workplace must also undergo FET. Individuals who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection in the past 270 days are exempted from the FET Requirement. Establishments can refer to the following Gobusiness portal link for more details.  

        From 1 October 2021, a “vaccinate or regular test” regime will be introduced for individuals working in personal care services. These employees are to be fully vaccinated or have to undergo regular testing. Unvaccinated employees and those who may be medically ineligible for vaccines on the National Vaccination Programme will be required to undergo twice weekly testing to mitigate risk of transmission to the public. The government will subsidise tests for the small group of individuals who are medically ineligible for vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme.

    - title: How can supermarket manage queues now that the measures may result in more people buying groceries to cook at home?
      content: |
        Supermarket retailers should implement other crowd management measures (e.g. limiting the number of shoppers within the store at any one time) to ensure that one metre spacing can be maintained between shoppers. They would also need to limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 5 persons, as well as maintain orderly queues in-store, and at entrance to store.

        Supermarkets are also encouraged to provide dedicated shopping hours for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and pregnant women. This can help to reduce intermingling to better protect those who are more vulnerable to COVID-19.

    - title: Are game arcades permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Yes, they can remain open. However, operators must practise safe management and safe distancing measures. They must ensure that common touchpoints are disinfected frequently.

    - title: Are playgrounds/ indoor playgrounds permitted to open? 
      content: |
        Common play areas for children/toddlers/infants in retail stores or malls can remain open. Operators of these play areas must ensure at least one-metre spacing between groups of customers.

    - title: Are personal care services permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Personal care services that require the removal of masks are allowed to resume if customers are fully vaccinated. These include beauty services and/or activities offered at retail outlets.

        Examples of such services include facial treatments, saunas, makeup services and portions of threading and facial grooming services, which require customers’ masks to be removed

    - title: Are massage/spa services permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Massage services are still allowed to operate within private rooms. However, customers will need to have their masks on at all times.

    - title: Will vaccines other than Moderna/Pfizer be recognised for VDS?
      content: |
        PSAR approved vaccines (i.e. Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna vaccines currently administered under the National Vaccination Programme), as well as vaccines on the World Health Organisation’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) (such as Sinovac-CoronaVac, Sinopharm, and AstraZeneca) are recognised for VDS. 
        
        Individuals who are vaccinated with WHO-EUL vaccines will be eligible for vaccination-differentiated SMMs only if their vaccination records have been captured in MOH’s National Immunisation Registry (NIR).

    - title: Do I have to check the vaccination status for customers doing takeaways?
      content: |
        There is no need to conduct VDS checks for customers doing takeaways. However, it is your responsibility to ensure that these customers do not consume food and drinks on premise. There should be clearly demarcated waiting areas for customers doing takeaways.

    - title: For VDS, I understand that the children in the group must be from the same household. What about the other individuals in the group? Can we be from different households?
      content: |
        Yes, eligible individuals (13 years old and above) in the group can be from different households; they need not be from the same household as the children. Within the group, only children (12 and under) need to be from the same household. 

    - title: My F&B establishment is an alfresco dine in concept and naturally ventilated just like hawker centres and coffee shops. Can I allow 2 pax to dine in without checking VDS eligibility?
      content: |
        No, you are not allowed to do so. The 2 pax dine-in (regardless of vaccination status) only applies to hawker centres and coffee shops, which generally refer to F&B establishments that hold an SFA coffee shop/ eating house/ canteen license. Hawker centres and coffee shops provide convenient and affordable food services within the community. As they are open-air and naturally ventilated spaces, a special concession is thus given to allow vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals to dine in these settings, but subject to a group size of up to 2 persons only. 

    - title: The capacity of my F&B establishment is small and cannot accommodate dine-in groups of 5 pax. Can I allow 2 pax to dine in without checking VDS eligibility?
      content: |
        No, you are not allowed to do so. Even if your F&B establishment can only accommodate tables for 2 pax, you are required to implement VDS. Alternatively, you may choose to do only takeaway services.

    - title: My shop offers hairdressing/manicure/pedicure services, and is considered part of the personal care services sector. Do I also need to implement VDS?
      content: |
        No, you do not need to. VDS is to be implemented for personal care services that require customers to remove their masks for the duration of the service. For example, make-up services, facial treatments and saunas. 

    - title: Can I allow a foreign customer who received his/her PSAR-approved vaccines overseas and provides proof of this vaccination to dine in my F&B establishment/ partake in personal care services provided at my shop?
      content: |
        Overseas vaccine certificates (hard or softcopy) will not be accepted for VDS. There will be a separate process for Short-Term Visitor Pass Holders who are vaccinated overseas to update their vaccination status on the National Immunisation Registry (NIR). This is still being worked out and details will be released soon.
        
        In the meantime, short-term visitors/ tourists can show their valid negative PET results from MOH-approved test providers to be accepted for VDS.

    - title: Why are overseas vaccination certificates not recognised for VDS?
      content: |
        Overseas vaccine certificates (hard or softcopy) will not be accepted for VDS because it is difficult for individual establishments to verify the authenticity of these certificates which are issued in different formats and languages.
