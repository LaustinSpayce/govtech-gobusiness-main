      <u>For all business owners except new business owners in the food services industry</u>  
      The right option, Self-Service feature (previously called LicenceOne) is for you, if you:
      - Have previously applied for licences or created application drafts on LicenceOne
      - Are a new business owner from any industry except food services

      <u>For new food services business owners</u>  
      The left option, Guided Journey feature, is for business owners in the food services industry, especially new ones who have not applied for any licences before. Guided Journey will walk you through the step-by-step process of applying for the licences your business needs. It is currently for food services businesses only (except standalone food stalls), and will be made available to other industries in future.

      If you are still not sure which option to select, please contact us.

      LicenceOne has been rebranded and is now known as GoBusiness Licensing. The Self-Service feature has all the same functions as LicenceOne and we have also added the new Guided Journey feature to walk beginners through the licensing process.

      This feature is currently only available for food & beverage businesses, and we are working on expanding this to other industries. In our mission to make the licensing process simpler, better and faster, we will be rolling out further enhancements to the Self-Service feature in phases.

      GoBusiness Licensing is in its launch phase and we are currently working towards extending this feature to more industries in future.
