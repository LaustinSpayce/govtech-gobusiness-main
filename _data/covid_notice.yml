  <p>Employers must implement workforce vaccination measures to keep your workforce safe and minimise strain on our healthcare capacity. Only employees who are fully vaccinated, or recovered from COVID-19 in the past 180 days are allowed to enter the workplace.</p>

  <p>Up to 50% of employees who can work from home are allowed to return to the workplace. Those who report to work onsite are encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).</p>
