    - title: Why is MOH distributing ART self-test kits to workplaces?
      content: |
        As part of the national effort to step up regular testing, companies are strongly encouraged to apply for ART kits to commence regular testing for employees who work on-site, but are not already on any form of mandatory Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). This will enable us to detect and ringfence cases, keeping the community safe. 

    - title: When should my company start the 8-weeks RRT?
      content: |
        Your company should start the weekly voluntary RRT for onsite employees with immediate effect, upon receipt of the ART kits. If you had deferred starting the weekly voluntary RRT due to the Government’s announcement in end-Sep to pivot towards full WFH, you may encourage your employees to use the kits to continue weekly testing from home. Alternatively, they may recommence testing upon return to office once WFH is no longer the default. 

    - title: My company applied for/received the ART kits before the government announced that WFH will be the default. Should my employees who have pivoted to full WFH still be tested weekly?
      content: |
        As your company has already applied for or received the kits, the employees who have pivoted to full WFH may use the kits to continue weekly testing from home. Alternatively, they may recommence testing upon return to office once WFH is no longer the default. During the results declaration at the end of each month's testing cycle, your company should still submit the declaration, and provide an explanation if the number of results declared is lower than the declared no. of onsite employees to be tested during application.

    - title: My company has missed the application deadline. Can we still apply?
      content: |
        The application period is from 16 Sep – 13 Oct 2021. Companies will not be able to apply after the application period. As the Time-Limited RRT was meant to be a one-time distribution exercise, we currently do not have plans to issue any more kits.

    - title: What processes should my company have in place to ensure that we are compliant?
      content: |
        Companies should have processes in place to ensure that the weekly tests are conducted properly, test results are recorded, and appropriate follow-up actions are adhered to. 

        If audited by the government, companies should be able to produce proof (e.g. email records, circulars, excel documents etc.) that such processes have been put in place and implemented. 

        |-|-|
        | Checklist of Processes | Suggested Practices|
        | Tests are properly conducted every week | * Provide employees with links to the self-test instructions and self-help materials.<br>* Request that employees submit photos of their used test kits displaying the results.<br>* Remind employees to conduct their weekly testing on a timely basis e.g. via email, messaging etc. |
        | Test results are recorded and submitted | * Provide a mode for employees to report their results e.g. via email, excel, HR portal etc.<br>* Verify that their employees have submitted their test results. |
        | Appropriate actions are taken if tested ART positive | * Share with employees on follow ups if tested ART positive. (refer to the question below on what to do when tested ART positive) <br>* Ensure that employees have adhered to the required follow-up actions by self-isolating for 72 hours if asymptomatic or getting a confirmatory PCR test if symptomatic. |

    - title: My company has yet to commence testing because we shifted fully to WFH. Do I still need to submit the results declaration at the end of the 2-month cycle from the date of receipt of kits?  
      content: |
        For companies who have yet to commence testing due to the shift to full WFH, they should still submit the results declaration at the end of each one-month cycle (for 2 months) from the date of receipt of kits, by indicating the number of tests they have conducted. If the actual number of employees tested is lower than the number of onsite employees declared during application, companies should provide a reasonable explanation why this is so in the submission form (e.g. pivot to WFH). 

        The company should also retain proof of communication sent to employees informing them that they will be working from home by default and the effective date of WFH implementation, which should be provided when audited by the Government. 

        Once WFH is no longer the default, companies are advised to re-commence testing upon return to office and continue submitting results until testing is complete. 

    - title: My company still has kits left after I completed the 8-weeks testing. Do we need to continue testing and submit the results declaration? 
      content: |
        If your company has completed the 8-weeks testing for all the onsite employees as declared during application but still has kits left (e.g. because staff recovered from COVID-19 and is exempted from testing, extra kits received due to rounding up), you may retain the kits for further voluntary testing. There is no need to submit additional results declaration in this situation.

    - title: How long does my company need to retain proof of processes and test results for?
      content: |
        For companies who would complete testing for all staff by 31 January 2022, please retain all necessary proof of test processes and test results until 31 January 2022.

        For companies who would still be conducting testing beyond 31 January 2022 due to various reasons, please retain all necessary proof/results for a duration of one month after the second round of results declaration. E.g. if testing ends on 15 February 2022, please retain the necessary proof/results until 15 March 2022. 

    - title: What actions will be taken if my company is found to be non-compliant?
      content: |
        The Government shall have the right to claw back the cost of any test kits should any of the information submitted in the application form or results declaration form be untrue, or if non-compliance to the testing requirements is found.

    - title: How accurate is ART?
      content: |
        ART is faster and less intrusive than a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. This makes it easy for the public to use to test themselves if needed. In general, ARTs have a sensitivity (ability of a test to identify patients with the disease) of about 80% for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity (ability of a test to identify patients without the disease) range of 97-100%.

    - title: Is ART painful?
      content: |
        ART is conducted by inserting a swab stick approximately 2cm into the nostril. These swabs are shallower and less intrusive than the nasopharyngeal swabs taken for PCR tests. Users may experience some discomfort, but the swabs should not be painful.

    - title: Is frequent ART swabbing harmful to me?
      content: |
        Frequent swabbing has not been proven to be harmful. ART swabs are inserted at around 2cm into the nostril, which are shallower and less intrusive than the nasopharyngeal swabs taken for PCR tests. However, if you have had recent facial surgery or frequent nose bleeds, you are advised to visit a [licensed ART provider](https://moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/covid19_test_providers/approved-covid-19-art-swab-provider-(caa-18-june).pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to have a professional perform the ART for you.

        If you are feeling unwell, please visit a SASH clinic listed on [phpc.gov.sg](https://phpc.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} immediately to seek medical attention. Please do not perform any ART self-testing if you are unwell

    - title: If I am feeling unwell on the day of testing (i.e. have sore throat, cough or fever), should I still proceed to do the test?
      content: |
        If you are experiencing acute respiratory symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, flu or runny nose), please visit a Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinic listed on phpc.gov.sg immediately. Please do not perform any ART self-testing.

    - title: What do my results mean?
      content: |
        <u>Negative</u>: Even if you test negative, please stay vigilant. Do continue to observe safe distancing measures and practice good personal hygiene such as regular handwashing and wearing a mask when leaving your home. Continue to monitor your health and test yourself where necessary.

        <u>Positive</u>: You may be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If you are well and do not have symptoms, please isolate yourself and re-test yourself with further ART tests after 72 hours from the initial positive test. You may resume normal activities if you test negative. If it is positive, continue to self-isolate and repeat antigen rapid tests at least one day apart. You can stop self-isolation and resume daily activities when it tests negative. If you feel unwell e.g. fever, cough, sore throat at any point in time, please proceed to the nearest SASH clinic or PHPC for a medical assessment. 
        
        To keep a record the positive results, you should take a photograph of your ART test results with your identification document (e.g. NRIC/passport) in the same photo.

        <u>Invalid</u>: An invalid test may mean that the test was not performed correctly, or the test kit was faulty. You should re-read the instructions on how to perform the test and repeat an ART with a new test kit until you get a valid ART result. You may also consider undergoing a self-paid ART which is supervised or done by a healthcare provider, such as at Quick Test Centres or medical clinics.

    - title: What should I do if I experience nose bleeding after swabbing?
      content: |
        Please consult a doctor if you experience persistent nose bleeding.

    - title: How should I dispose the used test kit?
      content: |
        After reading the results, please take a photo with your ID in the same photo if the result is positive or both results are invalid.

        To dispose the test kit, place all the used items from the test kit into a plastic bag or a sealable bag and seal it. Place the sealed bag into another plastic bag. Tie the second plastic bag with a rubber band or cable tie. Please ensure that the bags are tightly tied to protect your community. Throw it into the rubbish chute or a pedal bin immediately.

    - title: What should I do if I test ART positive?
      content: |
        You should isolate yourself at home if you are well and test positive. 

        After 72 hours, repeat an ART. You can resume daily activities if it tests negative. If it is positive, continue to self-isolate and repeat ARTs at least one day apart. You can stop self-isolation and resume daily activities when it tests negative.

        If you feel unwell e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, go to a SASH clinic via private transport to be assessed medically by a doctor.

    - title: What should I do as part of self-isolation?
      content: |
        You should take steps and make arrangements to make sure that you can isolate yourself from other persons in your household. You should minimise interactions with other household members, and practise good hygiene habits. These include:

        - Staying in a room on your own as much as possible and keeping the door closed
        - If you have to share a bathroom, clean it each time you use it by wiping surfaces
        - Wash your hands often
        - Keep the windows open to ensure the house is well-ventilated
        
        You should not leave the home unless to seek medical care for COVID-19.

    - title: What should I do if I do not have an ART test to do the repeat tests?
      content: |
        You may use the ART kits that your company has applied for you to conduct the repeat tests. If that is not available or accessible, your family and friends can help to purchase or you can purchase them online.

    - title: If I test ART positive, when should I proceed to receive a confirmatory PCR test instead of self-isolating? 
      content: |
        You should proceed to undergo a confirmatory PCR test instead of self-isolating if,

        - You feel unwill, such as having a fever, cough, sore throat, and a doctor advises you to take a confirmatory PCR test
        - You are aged above 80 years old (vaccinated) or above 70 years old (unvaccinated)

        Specific sectors may also have special considerations which, where applicable, should be separately communicated to you.

    - title: How much do I have to pay for the confirmatory PCR test?
      content: |
        If you are assessed by the doctor to meet the swabbing criteria, the cost of the confirmatory PCR test will be fully covered by the government. Please bring (1) the photo of your test results + ID and (2) your physical ID to the SASH clinic for the clinic's verification. Otherwise, you may be charged for your confirmatory PCR test at the clinic's prevailing charges.

        At the clinic, if your doctor informs you that you need a consultation, e.g. because of observed symptoms such as runny nose, mild fever, you should comply with your doctor's instructions.  The prevailing subsidies and fees will apply if needed.

    - title: What do I do if my confirmatory PCR test is positive?
      content: |
        If your PCR test is positive, MOH will contact you via phone call to provide instructions on the follow-up actions required. Please self-isolate until your results are out. 

    - title: What should my household members, colleagues or close contacts do if I am ART positive?
      content: |
        While they will not be issued a Health Risk Warning (HRW) given that this is an ART positive case, we advise they take the following precautions:
        
        - Minimise contact with the person who had tested ART positive
        
        - Take an ART self-test within 24 hours of their last contact with the person
        
        - Should they need to leave home over the next 7 days, e.g. to work or to school, take an ART self-test on the same day

          1. If negative, they may leave home

          2. If positive, follow the instructions for persons tested ART positive. 

        During the 7-day period, avoid unnecessary interactions with others as much as possible. 

    - title: My employee has tested ART positive, can I require that he/she undergoes a confirmatory PCR test?
      content: |
        Companies should not require employees to undergo a confirmatory PCR test unless they are unwell (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat), or are above 80 years old (vaccinated) or 70 years old (unvaccinated).

    - title: My employee has tested ART negative after having tested positive initially. Is it safe for him/her to return to work?
      content: |
        As long as a person without symptoms has tested negative on the antigen test that was done at least 72 hours after the initial positive test, the person can return to work safely. 

        There is no need for PCR testing before the person returns to work.
