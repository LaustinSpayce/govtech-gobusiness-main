    - title: Why is MOH distributing ART self-test kits to workplaces?
      content: |
        As part of the national effort to step up regular testing, companies are strongly encouraged to apply for ART kits to commence regular testing for employees who work on-site, but are not already on any form of mandatory Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). This will enable us to detect and ringfence cases, keeping the community safe. 

    - title: Which companies are eligible to apply for kits?
      content: |
        Companies with employees that work onsite and are not already subject to mandatory RRT, may voluntarily apply for 8 ART kits per onsite employee for weekly testing of their staff over a two-month period. Employees include full-time and part-time employees, and students on long-term (at least 2 months) placement or internship, regardless of vaccination status.

    - title: Can companies with employees that meet the eligibility criteria choose not to apply for the ART test kits?
      content: |
        Applying for the ART kits is voluntary. Nevertheless, companies are strongly encouraged to do so.  

    - title: When should my company start the 8-weeks RRT?
      content: |
        Your company should start the weekly RRT with immediate effect, upon receipt of the ART kits.

    - title: I am a home-based business owner/self-employed person. Can I apply for the ART kits?
      content: |
        As long as your business is UEN-registered and you have a valid Corppass, you will be eligible to apply for kits for employee(s) that work on-site and are not already subject to mandatory RRT. 

    - title: If employees are working on a split-team arrangement and returning to office on alternate weeks, are they eligible for the kits?
      content: |
        Your company may apply for staff who are returning to office only on alternate weeks. They should continue to self-test even for weeks where they are working from home.  

    - title: Can my company apply for additional kits, in case of invalid test results?
      content: |
        Invalid results are extremely rare. If there are insufficient test kits arising from retesting due to invalid results, your company may purchase additional kits to complete the regime for the affected employee. Otherwise, the company should note during results recording that there is a missing test due to past invalid results.

    - title: What processes should my company have in place to ensure that we are compliant?
      content: |
        Companies should have processes in place to ensure that the weekly tests are conducted properly, test results are recorded, and appropriate follow-up actions are adhered to. 

        If audited by the government, companies should be able to produce proof (e.g. email records, circulars, excel documents etc.) that such processes have been put in place and implemented. 

        |-|-|
        | Checklist of Processes | Suggested Best Practices|
        | Tests are properly conducted every week | * Provide employees with links to the self-test instructions and self-help materials.<br>* Request that employees submit photos of their used test kits displaying the results.<br>* Remind employees to conduct their weekly testing on a timely basis e.g. via email, messaging etc. |
        | Test results are recorded and submitted | * Provide a mode for employees to report their results e.g. via email, excel, HR portal etc.<br>* Verify that their employees have submitted their test results. |
        | Appropriate actions are taken if tested ART positive or double Ag invalid | * Share with employees on follow ups if tested ART positive. (refer to question below on what to do) <br>* Ensure that employees who are tested ART positive/double Ag invalid have gone for a confirmatory PCR test at a SASH clinic. |

    - title: Does my company have to submit my employees’ test results to the government?
      content: |
        Companies are not required to submit detailed results of each employee to the government. Nevertheless, companies are required to submit their ART results declaration at the end of each month’s testing cycle (i.e. twice across the two-month period) to the government via this link: [https://go.gov.sg/time-limited-rrt-art-results-declaration](https://go.gov.sg/time-limited-rrt-art-results-declaration){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}

    - title: How accurate is ART?
      content: |
        ART is faster and less intrusive than a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. This makes it easy for the public to use to test themselves if needed. In general, ARTs have a sensitivity (ability of a test to identify patients with the disease) of about 80% for cases with higher viral loads and a specificity (ability of a test to identify patients without the disease) range of 97-100%. As the sensitivity and specificity of ARTs are lower as compared to PCR tests, if you test ART-positive or invalid twice, you will need to follow up with a confirmatory PCR test at a Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinic. You should not repeat the ART. Even if you do test ART-negative in the repeated test, it may be a false negative result and hence you need to go for a confirmatory PCR test.

    - title: Is ART painful?
      content: |
        ART is conducted by inserting a swab stick approximately 2cm into the nostril. These swabs are shallower and less intrusive than the nasopharyngeal swabs taken for PCR tests. Users may experience some discomfort, but the swabs should not be painful.

    - title: Is frequent ART swabbing harmful to me?
      content: |
        Frequent swabbing has not been proven to be harmful. ART swabs are inserted at around 2cm into the nostril, which are shallower and less intrusive than the nasopharyngeal swabs taken for PCR tests. However, if you have had recent facial surgery or frequent nose bleeds, you are advised to visit a [licensed ART provider](https://moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/covid19_test_providers/approved-covid-19-art-swab-provider-(caa-18-june).pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to have a professional perform the ART for you.

        If you are feeling unwell, please visit a SASH clinic listed on [phpc.gov.sg](https://phpc.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} immediately to seek medical attention. Please do not perform any ART self-testing if you are unwell

    - title: If I am feeling unwell on the day of testing (i.e. have sore throat, cough or fever), should I still proceed to do the test?
      content: |
        If you are experiencing acute respiratory symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, flu or runny nose), please visit a Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinic listed on phpc.gov.sg immediately. Please do not perform any ART self-testing.

    - title: What do my results mean?
      content: |
        <u>Negative</u>: Even if you test negative, please stay vigilant. Do continue to observe safe distancing measures and practice good personal hygiene such as regular handwashing and wearing a mask when leaving your home. Continue to monitor your health and test yourself where necessary.

        <u>Positive</u>: You may be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Please take a photograph of your ART test results with your identification document (e.g. NRIC/passport) in the same photo immediately and visit a Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinic for a confirmatory Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. The list of SASH clinics may be found at phpc.gov.sg. Bring (1) the photo of your results and ID together and (2) your physical ID (NRIC/Passport) to the clinic. Please refer to the next question on how to make your way safely to the clinic.

        <u>Invalid</u>: An invalid test may mean that the test was not performed correctly. You must perform a second ART test immediately. If your second ART test is still invalid, please take a photo of the test result(s) with your identification document (ID) in the same photo immediately and call a SASH clinic to make an appointment for a confirmatory PCR test. The list of SASH clinics may be found at phpc.gov.sg. Please bring (1) the photo of your results + ID together and (2) your physical ID (NRIC/Passport) to the clinic.

    - title: If I test ART-positive or invalid twice, what do I do?
      content: |
        * Call the nearest SASH clinic listed on [phpc.gov.sg](https://phpc.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to make an appointment and confirm that they can provide a confirmatory PCR test. At the clinic, if your doctor informs you that you need a consultation, e.g. because of observed symptoms such as runny nose, mild fever, you have to comply with your doctor’s instructions.

        * Take a photo of your ART test result(s) with your identification document (ID) in the <b>same photo</b> immediately. Dispose the used test kit by properly and wash your hands. 

        * Bring (1) the photo of your results + ID together and (2) your physical ID (NRIC/Passport) to the clinic.

        * Travel to the clinic via private transport (car or taxi). Sit alone in the back seat and on the opposite side of the driver. Wind down the windows (switch off air-conditioning) and wear a surgical mask throughout the ride. If you ride a motorcycle, please ensure that you do not have a pillion rider.

        * If you require a taxi, please do not take a street-hire taxi. Instead, book a taxi through:

          * <b>Call the taxi hotlines</b>: Inform the operator that you are going for a PCR test at a SASH clinic.

          * <b>Mobile application of transport companies</b>: Input “SHN” in the comment box or check the “SHN” checkbox (if available).

        * <b>After the confirmatory PCR test, please go home immediately via private transport (same arrangement above), and self-isolate at home until you receive your negative PCR test results.</b>

        * If you are unable to self-isolate at home, please inform your clinic before the swab so that alternative arrangements may be made.

        * Your doctor will generally inform you of your results within 24 to 48 hours. Alternatively, you may check your results via [HealthHub](https://www.healthhub.sg/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

    - title: How much do I have to pay for the confirmatory PCR test?
      content: |
        If you are assessed by the doctor to meet the swabbing criteria, the cost of the confirmatory PCR test will be fully covered by the government. Please bring (1) the photo of your test results + ID and (2) your physical ID to the SASH clinic for the clinic’s verification. Otherwise, you may be charged for your confirmatory PCR test at the clinic’s prevailing charges.

        At the clinic, if your doctor informs you that you need a consultation, e.g. because of observed symptoms such as runny nose, mild fever, you have to comply with your doctor’s instructions.  The prevailing subsidies and fees will apply if needed.

    - title: What do I do if my confirmatory PCR test is positive?
      content: |
        If your PCR test is positive, MOH will contact you via phone call to provide instructions on the follow-up actions required. Please self-isolate until your results are out. 

    - title: What should I do if I experience nose bleeding after swabbing?
      content: |
        Please consult a doctor if you experience persistent nose bleeding.

    - title: How should I dispose the used test kit?
      content: |
        After reading the results, please take a photo with your ID in the same photo if the result is positive or both results are invalid.

        To dispose the test kit, place all the used items from the test kit into a plastic bag or a sealable bag and seal it. Place the sealed bag into another plastic bag. Tie the second plastic bag with a rubber band or cable tie. Please ensure that the bags are tightly tied to protect your community. Throw it into the rubbish chute or a pedal bin immediately.
