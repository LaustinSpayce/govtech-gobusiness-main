    - title: Why are patrons required to undertake a supervised Antigen Rapid Test (ART) for premises which provide dancing as an intended activity for customers?
      content: |
        The dance setting within nightlife establishments entails a large number of people coming into close contact for prolonged periods of time and in enclosed spaces. A negative ART supervised by an MOH-approved test provider is required to ensure that public health risks associated with COVID-19 are mitigated.

    - title: Is supervised ART required for customers entering karaoke establishments?
      content: |
        ART supervised by an MOH-approved test provider is only required for establishments intending to offer dancing among patrons as an activity. This is not only limited to nightclubs and discotheques, but may also apply to any other establishments intending to offer such an activity.

    - title: How do I determine if my establishment is required to implement supervised ART testing for patrons?
      content: |
        Supervised ART test for patrons is required as long as the premise offers dancing among patrons as an intended activity. This will apply mainly to nightclubs and discotheques, but will also apply to any other establishments, including F&B, bars/pubs and karaoke businesses, intending to offer dancing among patrons, for instance, by providing a common area or stage.

        If your establishment intends to provide dancing among patrons as an activity, you will need to ensure that all patrons entering your premises have a cleared Pre-Event Test status on their TraceTogether mobile application or received a negative ART test result from a MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider over SMS/email. 

        Establishments that do not wish to offer dancing among patrons as an activity despite holding a valid Category 1 PE licence to do so should ensure that no dancing among patrons takes place within your premises. If this is enforced by your establishment, no supervised ART testing will be required for patrons. 

    - title: How long is the customer's ART test valid for?
      content: |
        Each ART test is valid for 24 hours from the time of testing. The supervised ART for patrons is to be administered no more than 24 hours prior to the event or activity's <u>end time</u>. Nightlife establishments must ensure that patrons' supervised ART tests remain valid for as long as the customer is in the premises, or throughout the duration of the nightlife event or activity at the premises, whichever is longer. 

    - title: How do I ensure that patrons comply with Safe Management Measures (SMMs), such as ensuring safe distancing between groups and mask-wearing, if I wish to provide dancing as an activity in my premises?
      content: |
        Nightlife businesses may consider putting in place physical demarcations and/or have staff members present at the dancefloor, among other steps, to ensure SMMs are adhered to while dancing occurs among patrons.

    - title: Is mask-wearing required when carrying out karaoke activities and/or dancing among patrons at nightlife premises?
      content: |
        In accordance with prevailing SMMs, mask-wearing will continue to be required for indoor settings, including karaoke establishments, nightclubs and discotheques. Masks may be removed for the consumption of food and beverages, and should be put back on immediately after eating or drinking.

    - title: For karaoke establishments that allow customers to sing on stage, will such customers be required to unmask when singing?
      content: |
        No. Masking-wearing is required regardless of whether singing takes place on stage. Masks may be removed for the consumption of food and beverages, and should be put back on immediately after eating or drinking.

    - title: Are Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs (VDS) checks required at the premises if the premises is located inside a building (e.g., shopping centre, hotel, etc.) and VDS checks are already carried out at the building entrance?
      content: |
        Given that nightlife activities generally carry a greater risk of COVID-19 transmission, nightlife businesses will still be required to ensure VDS are in place at their premises. In addition, nightlife businesses must also ensure capacity limits are adhered to prior to allowing patrons to enter their premises.

    - title: How do I check if URA's planning permission has been granted for bar/ pub, nightclub/ karaoke lounge use at the subject premises?
      content: |
        You may do so via URA SPACE ([here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}), under the 'Download Planning Decisions' tab. For other licensing matters, please check directly with SPF and SFA.

    - title: The planning permission for bar/ pub, nightclub /karaoke lounge use within my unit had lapsed. Can I apply to URA to renew it?
      content: |
        You can submit the Change of Use application via the GoBusiness Licensing Portal [here](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/web/frontier/home){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Applicants are to first obtain the land/property owner's written consent for the proposal before submitting the application. In the submission, the land/property owner's consent, business concept, food and drinks menu and a floor plan showing the layout of the premises must be included. The processing time of a Change of Use application is approximately 10 working days. More time may be required if the submission is incomplete.

    - title: Can I still operate as a nightlife business (i.e., bar/ pub, nightclub/ karaoke lounge) if I do not have URA's planning permission?
      content: |
        No. You will first need to submit a Change of Use application to URA, and approval is not guaranteed. In evaluating the proposal, URA will consider the prevailing planning policies, site context, impact of the use on surrounding development and input from relevant agencies. There are locations where URA will not grant new approvals for such use due to dis-amenities caused by such nightlife businesses in the area (refer to the [URA website](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Business/Change-Use-of-Property-for-Business/~/link.aspx?_id=B3B45584F9414B3FAD9C8FB66310358F&_z=z){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more information). Operators who have obtained URA's approval may then proceed to apply to SPF and SFA for relevant licenses.

    - title: Will the Change of Use application process be expedited?
      content: |
        It generally takes 10 working days for Change of Use applications to be assessed. More time may be required if the submission is incomplete.

        a)	URA's planning permission for bar/pub, nightclub/karaoke lounge use at the premises;

        b)	Corresponding Liquor Licence / PE Licence from SPF (if applicable); and

        c)	SFA's Foodshop (Pub/Bar/Nightclub/Disco) Licence

    - title: The planning permission for the bar/pub, nightclub/karaoke lounge use is still valid. However, the name of applicant reflected on the planning permission is not mine. Do I need to submit a new application to URA?
      content: |
        Planning permissions are granted to the premises and not a specific operator. Hence, you do not have to submit a new application for a change in operator. Nonetheless, please ensure that the relevant planning conditions for the use are complied with. 

    - title: My company received the financial support package that was offered by the Government to pivot to other operations or exit the industry. Can my company reopen as a nightlife business?
      content: |
        In line with the conditions for receiving the nightlife support package, the firm will not be allowed to reopen for 12 months upon receipt of either the exit or pivot support package. For firms receiving the exit grant, this will be from the date that firms obtain documented proof^ of commencement of business closure. For firms receiving the pivot grant, this will be from the date that the Letter of Offer was issued. For more clarification on the nightlife support packages, please reach out to ESG directly. 

        ^This may include any one of the following: (i) Strike-off notice from ACRA; (ii) Proof of participation in the Simplified Insolvency Programme; (iii) Notice of Winding-up Order and proof of engaging liquidator(s) for companies undergoing compulsory winding up; or (iv) Proof of appointment of provisional liquidator for companies undergoing voluntary winding up.

    - title: I am currently operating a temporary F&B outlet with MTI's conditional permit. Can I revert to my original nightlife business (i.e., bar/ pub, nightclub/ karaoke lounge)?
      content: |
        If you hold the approvals/licences which are still valid for the premises, you may proceed to resume operations as a bar/pub, nightclub/karaoke lounge. These approvals/licences would include, but not limited to:

        a) URA's planning permission for bar/pub, nightclub/karaoke lounge use at the premises;

        b) Corresponding SPF's Liquor Licence / PE Licence from SPF (if applicable); and

        c) SFA's Foodshop (Restaurant / Snack Counter) Licence. As per paragraph 7 of the advisory, SFA will convert your licence back to Foodshop (Pub/Bar/Nightclub/Disco) and keep you informed.

    - title: With the resumption of nightlife businesses, will operators still be required to adhere to the additional Safe Management Measures (SMMs) set out in the conditional permit?
      content: |
        The conditional permit issued for the temporary resumption of F&B operations for pivoted nightlife establishments will be rescinded on 19 April 2022. Operators will no longer be required to obtain a conditional permit in order to resume nightlife activities. However, operators are reminded to adhere to the SMMs set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the advisory. Agencies will continue to monitor the compliance of SMMs and will take firm enforcement action against operators and individuals who flout SMMs, to which penalties include prosecution and the revocation of licences.

    - title: Am I required to change my SSIC code before resuming operations as a nightlife establishment?
      content: |
        Operators should update their SSIC codes to reflect the correct business activity taking place at their premises.

    - title: I am currently holding a Foodshop (Snack Counter) licence in order to temporarily operate as a F&B outlet. Will I be required to submit a new application to SFA to obtain a Foodshop (Bar/Pub/Nightclub/Disco) licence before I can revert to my usual nightlife operations?
      content: |
        SFA will be updating your licence to a Foodshop (Pub/Bar/Nightclub/Disco) licence automatically. No new application is required, but please print out your licence when you have received notification of the change. Please also ensure that you have the valid approvals/licences, including, but not limited to the land-use approval and licences from URA and SPF respectively, prior to resuming nightlife operations. 

    - title: I have URA's endorsement for a temporary conversion to pivot to F&B operations and not a Change of Use approval. Can I choose to retain my Foodshop (Snack Counter) licence if I wish to continue my existing F&B operations on a permanent basis?
      content: |
        If your firm intends to operate as a restaurant, you should apply [here](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/web/frontier/home){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to change the use of your premises to a restaurant or snack counter. URA will consider the prevailing planning policies, site context, impact of the use on surrounding development and input from relevant agencies in evaluating your proposal. Subject to URA’s approval, you will then be required to make a fresh application for a Foodshop (Snack Counter) or Foodshop (Restaurant) licence with SFA.

    - title: My company is classified as a nightlife establishment based on the land-use approval for the premise. Can my company continue to operate as a F&B outlet after the conditional permit has been rescinded?
      content: |
        The incidental sales and consumption of food to support the nightclub/bar operations is permitted and further planning permission is not required from URA. However, if your firm intends to operate as a full-fledged restaurant, you should apply [here](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/web/frontier/home){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to change the use of your premises to a restaurant. URA will consider the prevailing planning policies, site context, impact of the use on surrounding development and input from relevant agencies in evaluating your proposal. If planning permission is obtained, you will then need to contact SFA via the online feedback form on its website to make a request and submit the approval.

    - title: Establishments that have pivoted to F&B are currently not allowed to provide dart boards, dice games, karaoke machines, and pool tables. Will these restrictions continue to be applied to nightlife businesses when the nightlife sector reopens?
      content: |
        From 19 April 2022 onwards, nightlife establishments may provide public entertainment activities, which include dart boards, karaoke equipment, and pool tables, provided they possess the requisite PE licences.

    - title: My company had previously breached SMMs whilst operating as a pivoted nightlife establishment and was not allowed to resume operations after the suspension. Is my company allowed to reopen as a nightlife business on 19 April 2022?
      content: |
        All nightlife establishments will be permitted to fully reopen from 19 April 2022, provided that they possess the valid land-use approvals and licences (e.g., SFA’s Foodshop, SPF’s liquor and PE licences) to do so. Nightlife operators are reminded to adhere to all prevailing SMMs that are applicable to your business activities. Agencies will continue to monitor the compliance of SMMs, and will take firm enforcement action against operators and individuals who flout SMMs, to which penalties include prosecution and the revocation of licences.

    - title: Which pivoted nightlife establishments will not be allowed to reopen?
      content: |
        Operators which are not allowed to resume operations will be notified by agencies.  They had previously breached Safe Management Measures (SMMs), including failing to prevent large groups of patrons from intermingling; allowing live entertainment (e.g. live singing and dancing, playing of musical instruments) and games (e.g. dice and billiards); and failing to ensure 1 metre safe distancing between customers and staff.

        The list of pivoted nightlife establishments which are not permitted to open is available on GoBusiness Singapore [here](/images/covid/Permitted Services (23 March 2022).pdf){:target="_blank"}.

    - title: Why are the measures exceptionally strict for pivoted nightlife establishments? 
      content: |
        Some nightlife establishments which pivoted to F&B operations had continued to carry out activities associated with nightlife activities, in flagrant disregard of SMMs. Persistent breaches of these SMMs and the cluster outbreak at pivoted establishments have made it necessary for the Government to tighten measures, so as to further mitigate public health risks and facilitate enforcement checks.

    - title: When will these stringent measures be eased, given the adverse impact on the nightlife industry?
      content: |
        These measures will be reviewed as and when necessary, such as when we have reached an endemic COVID-19 situation in Singapore.

    - title: What will happen to establishments which do not pass the inspections? Will they be allowed to apply to be inspected again?
      content: |
        Establishments that do not pass inspections will not be allowed to reopen until they pass a later inspection, which they may apply for when they are ready.

    - title: Can establishments which are not allowed to resume operations file an appeal?
      content: |
        Establishments may write to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) via covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg to appeal against the decision of non-resumption of operations.  

    - title: Can nightlife operators apply to convert their premises to full-fledged F&B operations for the longer term?
      content: |
        Operators can apply to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) to convert their premises to a restaurant for the longer term at [https://licence1.business.gov.sg/feportal/web/frontier/home](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/feportal/web/frontier/home){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Only proposals for full-fledged restaurants may be considered, subject to full compliance with the restaurant guidelines, including the provision of proper kitchens. However, as announced on 16 July 2021, the processing of applications has been suspended until 15 October 2021, pending review of the requirements.

    - title: Can nightlife operators apply to convert their premises to non-F&B operations?
      content: |
        Operators will need to make a Change of Use application with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) if they wish to use their premises for other activities. The application is subject to assessment, taking into consideration the planning intention for the site, compatibility, and potential impact of the proposed use with the surroundings, and the prevailing policies/guidelines.

    - title: Why did the Government allow nightlife establishments to pivot to F&B operations?
      content: |
        The nightlife industry is the only industry that has not been allowed to operate throughout the pandemic. As such, government agencies had worked together to help interested operators temporarily pivot to other operations in a quick and less costly manner, such that the operators would be able to revert to their usual operations when the nightlife sector is able to reopen. There are an estimated 10,000 locals employed in this sector. This move allowed nightlife establishments to at least have some revenue in the interim.

        Besides temporarily pivoting to F&B operations, nightlife establishments may also apply to convert operations to another industry insofar as they obtain a Change of Use approval from the URA and meet the various requirements. 

    - title: How long is the validity of the food licence under the temporary pivot scheme? Can the validity be extended?
      content: |
        There is no extension of the one-year food licence under the temporary pivot scheme.

        Operators which intend to operate F&B services after the expiry of the one-year food license will need to obtain a Change of Use approval from the URA to convert to a restaurant. Only proposals for full-fledged restaurants may be considered, subject to full compliance with the restaurant guidelines, including the provision of proper kitchens.

    - title: How do I know if I'm classified as a non-permitted nightlife business and if the following FAQs apply to me?
      content: |
        This set of FAQs applies to businesses that are pubs, nightclubs, discotheques, dance clubs, and karaoke outlets. It covers companies that hold an SFA Foodshop (Pubs, Bars, Nightclub, Discos) licence, and have not been permitted to operate since March 2020.

    - title: Why are nightlife businesses not allowed to reopen? When will they be allowed to resume?
      content: |
        Nightlife establishments will not be able to reopen in their original form for some time. The settings of nightlife activities entail a large number of people coming into close contact for prolonged periods of time, and often in enclosed spaces, which pose a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission. Hence, we are taking a cautious approach in the reopening of this sector and must ensure that the public health risks associated with COVID-19 are mitigated before doing so.

        To help affected nightlife businesses during this period, the Government will provide financial support to nightlife businesses that wish to pivot their businesses to activities that are currently permitted, or to exit the industry. We had previously announced that we will also work with the nightlife industry on a few pilots to reopen the sector with safe management measures (SMMs) in place. While the pilot for bars and pubs commenced in December 2020, the pilot for nightclubs and karaoke outlets has been deferred in view of the increase in community cases.

    - title: What assistance is available for nightlife operators that wish to convert operations to a permitted activity?
      content: |
        Nightlife operators that wish to convert operations to a permitted activity may apply to Enterprise Singapore (“ESG”) for a grant to defray qualifying costs incurred during the pivoting process such as costs related to refurbishment works, and the purchase of kitchen and service equipment.

        Companies can apply to ESG through the Singapore Nightlife Business Association (“SNBA”) at [helpdesk@snba.org.sg](mailto:helpdesk@snba.org.sg) to seek financial support for pivoting to other uses. The support will be available until 30 September 2021.

    - title: What other support measures are there if operators choose not to pivot?
      content: |
        As nightlife businesses are not permitted to open for the time being, operators may consider making a commercial decision to pivot, remain closed or exit the industry, based on their own business assessment.

        For nightlife establishments intending to exit the industry, companies can apply to ESG through SNBA to seek financial support to offset one month of retrenchment benefit to be paid to local employees, capped at the industry median monthly wage of $3,000.

        Firms can also apply to ESG to seek an ex-gratia payment of $30,000 to defray the costs associated with the cessation of business.

        To begin your grant application process for winding down, please reach out to SNBA at [helpdesk@snba.org.sg](mailto:helpdesk@snba.org.sg). The support will be available until 30 September 2021.

    - title: Can companies which have taken up the pivot support package but later decide to cease business still qualify for the exit support package?
      content: |
        Companies which have received the pivot support package will not be eligible for the exit support package. We strongly advise companies to consider the available options and make their own business assessment on the next steps prior to any application for support.

    - title: Can companies which have pivoted to permitted activities or exited the industry prior to the effective date of the support packages (i.e. 6 November 2020) qualify for the pivot or exit support package respectively on a retrospective basis?
      content: |
        For nightlife operators who had taken the initiative to change their business activity earlier, ESG will be prepared to extend the pivot support package on a case-by-case basis. Operators may write to SNBA at [helpdesk@snba.org.sg](mailto:helpdesk@snba.org.sg) to appeal for the pivot support package. Such appeals will be assessed by ESG subsequently on a case-by-case basis.

        Nightlife operators who had exited the industry or are in the process of doing so may qualify for the exit support package if they are still registered with Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) at the point of application. The retrenchment benefit support will be tied to the number of local employees at the point of application. Employers who have retrenched their employees and provided the retrenchment benefit prior to the effective date of the exit support package may write to SNBA at [helpdesk@snba.org.sg](mailto:helpdesk@snba.org.sg). Such appeals will be assessed by ESG on a case-by-case basis.

    - title: Can a company participating in the pilot apply for the pivot or exit support package?
      content: |
        Companies which are recipients of the pivot or exit support package will not be eligible to participate in the pilots.

    - title: Are there any financial support provided under the Ministry of Law's Simplified Insolvency Programme (SIP)?
      content: |
        The Simplified Insolvency Programme (SIP) aims to provide simpler, faster, and lower-cost proceedings to assist micro and small companies in need for winding up or restructuring. It comprises two separate programmes: (a) Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme for viable businesses; and (b) Simplified Winding Up Programme for non-viable businesses.

    - title: How can I change my nightlife operations to activities that are permitted today? What kind of licences are required?
      content: |
        Nightlife operators intending to operate F&B establishments must submit a Change of Use application with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) to obtain planning permission to convert the premises into an F&B establishment.

        Nightlife operators that wish to convert to F&B operations should first register their interest with MTI through SNBA at [helpdesk@snba.org.sg](mailto:helpdesk@snba.org.sg). This would allow us to prioritise your subsequent regulatory submissions to the relevant agencies, as well as advise you on the support provided to nightlife operators.

        Nightlife operators which obtained URA's endorsement between 6 November 2020 and 14 May 2021 for a one-year temporary conversion to operate F&B activities will subsequently be required to file a Change of Use application with URA if they wish to continue F&B activities when their one-year temporary conversion expires.

    - title: Do nightlife businesses need to change their Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) code if they are changing business activity?
      content: |
        Nightlife businesses are required to change their SSIC code if their current code is not reflective of their new business activity. Operators who have converted to permitted activities should notify Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) by updating the changes of their company's information on BizFile+ within 14 days. You may login your Singpass [here](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

    - title: How long will the application for converting to a permitted activity take?
      content: |
        The process to acquire the necessary licences and approvals from relevant agencies to change to F&B operations will take approximately three weeks from the date of submission of a completed application. If there are substantial changes to your layout for changing to a restaurant or other commercial use, the process may take longer, depending on the type of renovation required.

    - title: If I were to successfully convert to a permitted activity, can the premises eventually revert to its original approved use, and will I be able to retain my current licences (e.g., public entertainment and liquor licences)?
      content: |
        Nightlife establishments that have received URA's endorsement for a one-year temporary conversion to F&B operations will be able to revert their premises to the original approved use within one year from receiving the SFA foodshop licence to carry out F&B operations, subject to the prevailing COVID-19 regulations and public health considerations associated with COVID-19. No change of use application is required.

        Operators who wish to operate F&B activities must apply for a new SFA foodshop (Restaurant/Snack Counter) licence and will not be allowed to amend their existing SFA PBND licence. Operators will not be able to hold both SFA foodshop and PBND licences concurrently.

        Public Entertainment (PE) licences which have been issued to operators will remain valid until their expiry date. Once the PE licences expire, operators who wish to provide PE other than the transmission of recorded music in restaurants, will need to apply for a new PE licence, subject to such activities being permitted by the Government at the time of application.

        Existing liquor licences that have been issued to operators will remain valid until their expiry date.

    - title: What is the difference between an SFA foodshop Restaurant licence and an SFA foodshop Snack Counter licence for operators planning to convert premise into an F&B establishment?
      content: |
        A Restaurant licence allows an operator to sell food that require extensive preparation or cooking. The operator needs to set up a full-fledge kitchen that has sufficient preparation and storage equipment, wash area, cooking range with exhaust system, etc.

        A Snack counter licence allows operators to sell food that can be cooked/heated up and do not require extensive food preparation, e.g., pizza (pre-packed frozen pizza from supermarket/factory), chicken wings, potato wedges, fishballs, etc. The operator will need basic cooking/heating equipment such as air-fryers, microwaves, ovens etc. Unlike for a restaurant licence, they will not need to set up a full-fledged kitchen.

    - title: What are the estimated costs for converting to a permitted activity?
      content: |
        Nightlife operators who wish to convert their operations to a permitted activity must file for a Change of Use application with the URA. The processing fees for a Change of Use application is $535 (inclusive of GST). Applicants would also need to pay the $195 licensing fee for the application of a new SFA foodshop licence, if applicable. Other costs that could be incurred include renovation costs and administrative costs, such as application for a fire safety certificate, if required.

    - title: Can Public Entertainment (PE) licence validity period be extended, or licence fees be refunded, if an operator is permitted to operate PE in the same premises in the future?
      content: |
        A PE licence is valid only for the period stated in the licence and the period cannot be varied.  For PE licensees who decide to terminate their licence as a result of the COVID-19 situation, and wish to seek a refund of the paid licence fees, the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”) will assess each request on a case by case basis. The operator may apply for a new PE licence in the future, but the application will be assessed based on its merits at that point and subject to the prevailing laws and policies.

        For specific queries, please email to the Police Licensing & Regulatory Department at [SPF_Licensing_Feedback@spf.gov.sg](mailto:SPF_Licensing_Feedback@spf.gov.sg).

    - title: Will I have to pay additional fees if my application for a change of use is rejected?
      content: |
        Applicants that have received an advisory note from URA to revise and re-submit their plans/proposal within the validity of the advisory note do not need to pay additional fees. However, applicants that have received a final rejection for a change of use would need to submit a fresh application if they wish to apply again.

    - title: Can nightlife operators collaborate with a neighbouring F&B outlet to serve food at their bar, pub, nightclub or karaoke outlet?

        All nightlife establishments that wish to convert their business activity to F&B are required to provide their food preparation area within the premises for food to be served at the same place.

        Operators may only work with another F&B establishment if the supplying establishment holds a food processing establishment licence from SFA. Nonetheless, nightlife operators would still be required to convert to an F&B establishment or other permitted commercial use in order to reopen.

    - title: If I choose to remain close, can I keep my Public Entertainment (PE) licence and reopen at another location when my business is permitted to resume?
      content: |
        The PE licence will remain valid for the period stated in the licence for the current location. The operator may apply for a new PE licence in the future for the new location, but the application will be assessed by the Police based on its merits and subject to the prevailing laws and policies.

    - title: Do nightlife premises need to undergo renovation in order to obtain the requisite permits/licences for converting operations to a permitted activity?
      content: |
        The renovation of your premise would be required if there is a substantial change in the layout of the premise, such as putting up a full-fledged kitchen if one is converting to a restaurant.

        Applicants should reach out to URA, SFA, or other relevant agencies to confirm if renovation is required, depending on the type of activity that applicants are converting to. Please refrain from committing on tenancy or renovation works before receiving confirmation from the relevant agencies.

    - title: Do I need to apply for a new fire safety certificate?
      content: |
        Operators should only apply for a new fire safety certificate with Singapore Civil Defence Force ("SCDF") if substantial changes to the layout of the premises (e.g., renovation) have been made, which require fire safety works.

        Such fire safety works include change in design and layout of fire compartments or spaces that affect means of escape, relocation of fire safety products (e.g. hose-reels, fire alarm panels, emergency exit signs, fire doors/doors which affect the means of escape), etc.

        Operators who wish to commence or carry out any proposed fire safety works in any building shall apply, in accordance with the Regulations made under the Fire Safety Act to SCDF for approval of the plan for fire safety works. Such plans shall be prepared and submitted by Qualified Persons (QPs) who are registered architects or professional engineers on behalf of the building owners. Upon full completion of all fire safety works, the QP engaged by the operator must apply and obtain the fire safety certificate before using or occupying the premises.

    - title: Do operators need to remove their existing bar counters in order to convert premise into an F&B establishment? What other requirements must I demonstrate to show that I have successfully converted to an F&B establishment?
      content: |
        To convert to a F&B establishment, there must be a kitchen or food preparation area located within the premise to prepare and serve food for patrons to dine in. The bar counter must also be repurposed for such uses.

        Restaurants are premises primarily used for the sale of food for consumption at the premise without performance of live music, or live entertainment. A restaurant cannot be used as a bar. For more details, you may refer to the criteria for restaurant [here](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Business/Change-Use-of-Property-for Business/~/link.aspx?_id=66F0F4C7BF5D4AF0BBF4A57540EF9B1A&_z=z){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. 

        If you intend to convert your premise to a restaurant, please first register your interest with MTI through SNBA at [helpdesk@snba.org.sg](mailto:helpdesk@snba.org.sg). This would allow us to prioritise your subsequent regulatory submissions to the relevant agencies, as well as advise you on the support provided to nightlife operators. You will subsequently be required to submit a Change of Use application with URA.

    - title: For premises with an approved smoking room, is there a need to apply to the National Environment Agency (“NEA”) again after converting to an F&B establishment or other commercial use?
      content: |
        Smoking rooms are not allowed within the F&B establishment, and all existing smoking rooms must remain closed during the period of conversion from a nightlife establishment to F&B establishment.

        When the premise is converted back to a nightlife establishment, the previously approved smoking room, which is contingent on the Public Entertainment Licence (PEL), may resume operations, subject to prevailing regulations on smoking facilities.

        In the event that the PEL is not renewed by the time of reversion, the smoking room must remain close until a valid PEL is obtained.

    - title: Why did the Government only decide to support one month of retrenchment benefit? Would the one month of support fulfil employers' full obligations towards the retrenchment benefit?
      content: |
        The payout is intended to help nightlife businesses who had not been allowed to operate, defray a portion of their retrenchment benefit to be paid to affected local employees during this challenging period. It is not intended to replace employers' contractual obligations.

        Employers are still expected to honour the retrenchment benefit amounts which are provided for in the employment contract, memoranda of understanding or collective agreement (for unionised companies) which are contractual entitlements. If unable to do so due to the financial circumstances, employers should negotiate with the unions/employees on a mutually acceptable retrenchment benefit package.

        If the retrenchment benefit is not contractually specified, employers should refer to the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”)'s “[Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment](http://www.mom.gov.sg/TAMEM){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}” and “[Advisory on retrenchment benefit payable to retrenched employees as a result of business difficulties due to COVID-19](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-retrenchment-benefit-to-retrenched-employees){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}” in deciding on the quantum of the retrenchment benefit.

        Employers are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advisories, including the provision of retrenchment benefit to help affected employees while they search for employment.

        We strongly encourage employers receiving the exit package to provide retrenchment benefit beyond the limits of the financial support provided by the Government.

    - title: Why is the retrenchment benefit support applicable for local employees only? What about foreign employees that have been retrenched?
      content: |
        Employers are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advisories, including to provide retrenchment benefits to help all affected employees, both local and foreign.

        In the event of a dispute, employees who wish to seek assistance can approach MOM for assistance. Employees with contractual claims (i.e. retrenchment benefit spelt out in the employment contract or collective agreement) for retrenchment benefit will be referred to the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management to file their claims. More details can be found [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/retrenchment-benefit){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

    - title: Can companies which are undergoing retrenchment but not intending to exit the industry still qualify for the retrenchment benefit support?
      content: |
        Only companies which are exiting the industry are eligible for the retrenchment benefit support. Companies which are currently participating in the pilot or suspending operations temporarily will not qualify.

    - title: Can a company which took up the exit grant still reopen when restrictions on nightlife establishments relax in the future?
      content: |
        The exit support package is intended for companies which are exiting from the industry. Companies which took up the exit support will not be allowed to participate in the pilot or reopen as a nightlife business for the next 12 months. Companies should consider the options and make their own business assessment before application.

    - title: Are there any other support schemes for retrenched workers by the Government?
      content: |
        Workers may refer to Workforce Singapore (“WSG”)'s website [here](https://content.mycareersfuture.sg/career-restarter-programme-c/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for resources on seeking alternative employment.

    - title: Can employers use the financial support payout for retrenchment benefit to fulfil other employment obligations e.g. outstanding salary?
      content: |
        No. Employers should continue to fulfil existing statutory/contractual obligations using their own finances. Failure to pay salary constitutes an offence under the Employment Act.

    - title: What other end-of-employment obligations should employers take note of?
      content: |
        Employers must give due notice or pay in lieu of notice and fulfil all other contractual obligations e.g. annual leave encashment, notice pay, before ending the employment relationship.

    - title: If there are disputes on retrenchment benefit payment paid out, what should employers/employees do?
      content: |
        Employers should provide retrenchment benefit depending on their financial position and adhere to the “[Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment](http://www.mom.gov.sg/TAMEM){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}” and “[Advisory on retrenchment benefit payable to retrenched employees as a result of business difficulties due to COVID-19](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-retrenchment-benefit-to-retrenched-employees){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}”.

        Employees who wish to seek assistance with their retrenchment can approach MOM. Employees with contractual claims (i.e. retrenchment benefit spelt out in the employment contract or collective agreement) for retrenchment benefit will be referred to the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management to file their claims.

    - title: What is deemed as a “cessation of business”?
      content: |
        The company's licenses should be terminated, and the company's name should be struck off from the register of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”). The company should submit (i) proof of rescission of operating licenses and (ii) notices and filings indicating commencement of strike-off or wind-up process (e.g. strike off notice from ACRA) within 3 months of receiving the letter of offer. Please refer to the ACRA website [here](https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/closing-a-company/closing-a-local-company){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for details on closing a company in Singapore.

    - title: What are the types of costs that a company can claim under the ex-gratia support?
      content: |
