<H3>Application Details</H3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Who can I contact for further details?</strong><br />For licensing enquiries, please contact the Radiation Protection and Nuclear Science Group (RPNSG) of the National Environment Agency (NEA) via <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/feedback">NEA's Online Feedback Form</a> or myENV app.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>How do I pay for the licence fees?</strong><br />Payment may be made online via e-Payment (e.g. NETS, PayPal, VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Discover) when submitting the licence application. GIRO payment is also applicable for billing to customers with existing GIRO arrangement with RPNSD. Applicants should indicate the GIRO reference number in the application form. The GIRO reference number can be found in the letter confirming the set-up of the GIRO account or on previously issued GIRO invoices. The applicant may provide the UEN number instead if the application is submitted using a CorpPass account tied to the same UEN that the GIRO account is tied to.<br /><br />To set up a GIRO account, please complete and submit the GIRO application form found on the NEA website: https://www.eportal.nea.gov.sg > Categories > Radiation Safety > eServices and Forms > GIRO Application Form for Radiation Licences.<br /><br />Please note that cheque payment is no longer accepted.<br /><br />As fees paid or submitted are non-refundable, please ensure that applications are submitted for the appropriate licences.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>How do I change the mailing / billing address or point of contact(s) (e.g. name, contact number and e-mail address) associated with my radiation licences?</strong><br />For any changes in mailing / billing address or point of contact(s) (e.g. name, contact number and e-mail address), please send your request to NEA_RPNSD_Licence@nea.gov.sg with the information to be amended / updated.<br /><br />Licences tied to UEN cannot be transferred from one organisation to another. Exceptions may be made for cases where there is a change of UEN arising from amalgamation or mergers or other processes where the former entity is legally recognised as becoming the new entity. Documentary proof (e.g. ACRA documents) must be provided. To check if a licence is eligible for transfer, please contact us at <a href="mailto:NEA_RPNSD_Licence@nea.gov.sg">NEA_RPNSD_Licence@nea.gov.sg</a>.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>I need more details about import and export licence. Where can I find it?</strong><br />A licence is required for the import or export of a consignment of irradiating apparatus and radioactive materials and the licence should be applied through Singapore Customs' TradeNet system. This is usually done by declaring agents which handle the Customs permit declaration of cargoes moving in and out of Singapore. The importers / exporters should ensure that their dealer licences are valid and have been updated to include the irradiating apparatus / radioactive materials, and that they have obtained the relevant possession licence if the apparatus is to be used at their premises.<br /><br />For more information, please refer to the following link: https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/radiation-safety/application-for-licence-to-import-or-export-irradiating-apparatus-and-radioactive-materials/application-for-licence-to-import-or-export-via-tradenet-system</li>
