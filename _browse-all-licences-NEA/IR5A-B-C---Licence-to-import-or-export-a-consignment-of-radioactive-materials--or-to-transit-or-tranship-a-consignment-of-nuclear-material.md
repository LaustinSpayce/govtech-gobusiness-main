A licence is required for the import or export of a consignment of irradiating apparatus and radioactive materials and the licence should be applied through Singapore Customs' TradeNet system. This is usually done by declaring agents which handle the Customs permit declaration of cargoes moving in and out of Singapore. The importers / exporters should ensure that their IR1 licences are valid and have been updated to include the irradiating apparatus / radioactive materials. For more information, please refer to the NEA webpage on Information on Licence to Import or Export Irradiating Apparatus and Radioactive Materials.

Who can I contact for further details regarding import or export of radiaoctive materials?
