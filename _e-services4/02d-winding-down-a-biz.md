## Winding down a business

There are different ways to close a business, depending on its business structure:

**Sole Proprietorship/Partnership**
<br>File for Cessation of Business on BizFile+. If it is GST-registered, the business owner must cancel the GST registration with Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS).

**Limited Partnership**
<br>File for Cessation of Limited Partnership on BizFile+. However, under certain circumstances (eg: discontinuation of partnership, death or bankruptcy of partners, by order of court), you can file for a dissolution instead.

**Limited Liability Partnership or Company**
<br>Apply for Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) to strike off your LLP or Company's name from its Register. However, under certain circumstances (eg: shareholder dispute, corporate restructuring), you can choose to liquidate the business instead.

Learn more about it at [ACRA's website](https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides){:target="_blank"}.
