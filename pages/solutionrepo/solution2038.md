### Description

The automatic nut splitter is used to cut through nuts within seconds, saving time during operation. It is a very useful for removing corroded nuts where a torque tool is unable to loosen the nut. It is also safer to operate as there are no open flames unlike using traditional torching and the risk of hand injury is also lower as compared to using a hammer and chisel.

Cost of equipment capped at $7,500 per unit
