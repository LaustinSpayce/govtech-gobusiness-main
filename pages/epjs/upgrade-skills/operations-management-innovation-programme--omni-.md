### Train key personnel to be technology innovators to achieve manufacturing excellence

The Operations MaNagement Innovation (OMNI) Programme is a joint initiative by the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech) and SSG. The programme aims to train key personnel such as engineers, managers and senior staff of companies to be technology innovators to achieve manufacturing excellence. Delivered based on SIMTech's proven Operations Management Innovation methodology (OmniMethodology), the programme comprises a 40-hour classroom training component in operations management techniques and another 40-hour mentorship by the experienced trainers to implement productivity improvement projects at the workplace.
