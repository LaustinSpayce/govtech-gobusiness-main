### Become an In-House Registered Training Provider to certify skills training of your employees

If you conduct structured on-the-job training or other classroom facilitated training at the workplace, and are intending to go a step further to formalise the training process, strengthen the training pedagogy and issue nationally recognised certifications to your employees, you can consider applying to SSG to become an in-house Registered Training Provider.
