### Receive salary support when you hire Singaporeans

The Hiring Incentive was first introduced as part of the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package (SMCSP) in the Unity Budget in 2020, to provide salary support for employers who hire local mid-career workers aged 40 and above through eligible reskilling programmes from 1 April 2020. It was enhanced subsequently in 27 May 2020 to apply to any hire from eligible reskilling and training programmes.

As part of the Government's continued effort to streamline the incentive schemes, the Hiring Incentive/Enhanced Hiring Incentive (JGI) has replaced the Enhanced Hiring Incentive since 1 Sep 2020, and the Enhanced Hiring Incentive had ceased on 31 Aug 2020.

Although the Hiring Incentive/Enhanced Hiring Incentive has ceased, companies that have hired local employees on eligible reskilling and training programmes from 1 April 2020 to 31 Aug 2020 will still benefit from the Hiring Incentive/Enhanced Hiring Incentive.
