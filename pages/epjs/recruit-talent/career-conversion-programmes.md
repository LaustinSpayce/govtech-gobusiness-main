Attach-and -Train: Mid-career individual is provided with training and work attachments, prior to job placement, through industry partners in growth sectors with good future job opportunities<br><br>3. Redeployment / Job Redesign (JR) Reskilling: Targeted at companies that are undergoing business transformation, and where their existing workers are at risk of redundancy or in vulnerable jobs due to the transformation. These workers will be provided with training to take on new job roles or redesigned job roles within the same company.
