#### For Businesses (Sole Proprietorships and Partnerships) and Limited Partnerships

The renewal fee is $30 for one year or $90 for three years. Please ensure you do not have any outstanding liabilities with CPF Board before renewal.

#### For Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP)

There must be annual declaration of solvency or insolvency and the first annual declaration must be lodged within 15 months from the date of registration of the LLP. Subsequent declarations must be lodged once every calendar year and not more than 15 months after the last lodgement.
