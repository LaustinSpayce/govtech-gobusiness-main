### About PW Mark and PW Mark Plus

The PW Mark is an accreditation scheme that recognises eligible firms that pay progressive wages to lower-wage workers. It is administered by the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) .

From March 2023, the Government will require suppliers who are awarded Government contracts to be accredited with the PW Mark, starting with contracts with larger value. More details will be announced in the coming months.

If you meet the eligibility requirements of the PW Mark and also adopt the Tripartite Standard on Advancing Well-being of Lower-Wage Workers (TS-LWW) , you will be conferred the PW Mark Plus.

Learn more about the Progressive Wage Model (PWM)  on the Ministry of Manpower website.
