## Imports & Exports

If you wish to import or export goods in and out of Singapore, you will need to activate your [Customs Account with Singapore Customs](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/new-traders-and-registration-services/overview){:target="_blank"} and apply for a customs permit. After that, you may appoint a Declaring Agent to apply for customs permits on your behalf [here](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/login.portal){:target="_blank"}.

Imported goods are subject to GST and/or duty payment. Examples include:

- Intoxicating liquors
- Tobacco products
- Motor vehicles
- Petroleum products
