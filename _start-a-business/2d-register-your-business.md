## Step 4: Register your business

#### Benefits of registering a business

There are several benefits of registering a business with ACRA. Here are some of them:

- The public can easily verify information about your business and its owners
- The public can easily identify, find and transact with your business
- You get to participiate in government tenders and secure intellectual property or patents for new products and technology
- Your business gets access to Government funding, such as Enterprise Singapore grants

In addition, if you incorporate a company or set up a limited liability partnership (instead of registering a sole proprietorship or partnership), your personal and business finances are kept separate. This means that in the event that your business is sued, your personal liabilities are limited and you do not risk losing your personal assets.

#### How to register a business

There are two ways to register your business:

1) Log in to BizFile+ [here](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/ngbbizfileinternet/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pages/BizfileHomepage.jspx#/){:target="_blank"} with your Singpass or Corppass to submit the application online. All proposed partners/managers will need to endorse their consent online via BizFile+ first before the application can be processed by ACRA, or

2) Engage a registered filing agent (e.g: law firm, accounting firm or corporate secretarial firm) to submit an online application on your behalf.

The pre-requisites, information and supporting documents needed for the application to register the business will vary, depending on the business structure type. Click on the respective business structure to find out more.

#### Unique Entity Number (UEN) and Business Profile

Upon successful registration of your new business, your business will be issued a [Unique Entity Number (UEN)](https://www.uen.gov.sg/ueninternet/faces/pages/admin/aboutUEN.jspx){:target="_blank"}. The UEN is your business' unique identification number that will be used in all transactions with government agencies.

A [free copy of Business Profile](https://www.acra.gov.sg/about-bizfile/updates-and-announcements/provision-of-free-business-profiles){:target="_blank"} for your business will be emailed to the person filing the application upon successful registration of your business.
