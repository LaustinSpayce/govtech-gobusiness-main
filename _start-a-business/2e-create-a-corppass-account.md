## Step 5: Create a CorpPass account

CorpPass is a single corporate digital identity that you require to transact with Singapore Government agencies, on behalf for businesses and other entities (eg: non-profit organisations and associations).

**With CorpPass, you can:**
- Manage users' access to digital services
- Customise digital service access of individual users within the entity
- Authorise third party service providers to transact on your behalf for selected digital services

Set up your Corppass account [here](https://www.Corppass.gov.sg/Corppass/common/findoutmore){:target="_blank"}.
