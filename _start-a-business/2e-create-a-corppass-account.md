## Step 5: Create a Corppass account

Now that you've registered your business, the next thing you must have to transact with Singapore Government agencies is a Corppass account. This is a single corporate digital identity for your business.

**With Corppass, you can:**
- Manage users' access to digital services
- Customise digital service access of individual users within the entity
- Authorise third party service providers to transact on your behalf for selected digital services

Set up your Corppass account [here](https://www.Corppass.gov.sg/Corppass/common/findoutmore){:target="_blank"}.
