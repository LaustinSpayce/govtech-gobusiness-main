## Step 2: Submit a business address

A business address is the place where you carry out your business. A P.O. Box address cannot be used as a business address.

All business owners and company officers must provide their residential address at the point of registration. These addresses are made publicly available when the public purchases information about the business entity.

If you are starting a home-based business and you intend to register it, your home address can also be used as the business address under the Home Office Scheme. You may apply for it with [Housing Development Board (HDB)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/home-business/home-offce-scheme){:target="_blank"} for HDB properties or Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) for private residential properties.

If you wish to protect your privacy, you can submit an Alternate Address for a fee of $40. The Alternate Address will be shown on public records instead of your personal residential address. However, please ensure you can be contacted at your Alternate Address. You are still required to submit your residential address for ACRA's records.

#### Using commercial space

If you're running your business from a commercial space, you will need to check the [allowable uses](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/){:target="_blank"} of your desired location. If your business activities are not allowed there, you may apply for planning permission to change the approved use of that premises for your intended use.
