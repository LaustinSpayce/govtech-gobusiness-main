## Step 3: Reserve your business name

Decide on a name for your business and use our [Start a Business e-Adviser](https://www.google.com.sg/){:target="_blank"} to check if it's available as a business name, trade mark, web domain and social media username.

Avoid names which are:
- identical to another business' name
- vulgar, obscene or offensive
- prohibited (e.g: Temasek)

If your preferred business name is not available, you may submit an appeal. You will need to upload the necessary documents to support your appeal.

To improve your chances of a successful application, read our [business name guidelines](https://www.acra.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/how-to-guides/lodging-complaints/acra's-policy-statement-on-the-treatment-of-business-names-and-name-complaints.pdf){:target="_blank"} for more details.

#### How to reserve your business name

After checking your desired name with the E-Adviser, you can reserve it for up to 120 days before registering your business. The name will be released after the reservation period.

There are two ways to reserve your business name:

1) [Log in to GoBusiness](https://www.google.com.sg/){:target="_blank"} with your Singpass or Corppass to submit the application online, or

2) Engage a registered filing agent (e.g: law firm, accounting firm or corporate secretarial firm) to submit an online application on your behalf.

The pre-requisites, information and supporting documents needed for the application to reserve the business name will vary, depending on the business structure type. Click on the respective business structure to find out more.

#### Review of applications by referral authorities

Certain names require approval from Referral Authorities. For example, names containing 'hospital', 'clinic', 'surgery', 'healthcare' will require approval from the Ministry of Health. In such cases, the application may take between 14 days to 60 days.

You can find the list of Referral Authorities [here](https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/before-you-start/referral-authorities){:target="_blank"}.

#### Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC)

**What is SSIC and why do i need it for my business?**
<br>The SSIC is a code assigned to classify your business activities carried out in Singapore. These codes are used by various government agencies for statistics and reporting purposes.

To reserve your business name, you will need to provide the SSIC code for your business activities. Different business activities each have a different 5-digit SSIC code. To find out your SSIC code, use our [Start a Business e-Adviser](https://www.google.com.sg/){:target="_blank"}. A complete list of the SSIC codes can be found [here](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/standards_and_classifications/industrial_classification/ssic2020-alphabetical-index.xlsx){:target="_blank"}.
