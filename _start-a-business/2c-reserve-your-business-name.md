## Reserve your business name

#### 3. Reserve your business name

**Reserve your business name** 
After checking your desired name with the Name Check tool, you can proceed to reserve it. Check the guidelines for business names to avoid rejection. 

The pre-requisites, information and supporting documents needed for the application to reserve the business name will vary, depending on the business structure type selected.

Once the application is approved, the business name will be reserved for you for up to 120 days before registering your business. After the reservation period has ended, the name will be released and made available to other members of the public.

You can now proceed to register your business to become officially operational. 

**What is SSIC and what does it mean to me**
The SSIC is a code assigned to classify your business activities carried out in Singapore. 

In order to submit the application to reserve your business name, you will need to indicate in your application the business activities your business will engage in.
