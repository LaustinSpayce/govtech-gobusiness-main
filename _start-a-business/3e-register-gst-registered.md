#### Register for GST

You will need to register for GST when:

- your taxable turnover exceeds $1 million or
- you can reasonably expect your taxable turnover in the next 12 months to exceed $1 million

If your taxable turnover does not exceed $1 million, you may still choose to register for GST. Apply for GST registration [here]().

Being GST-registered means:

- you have to charge customers GST for the goods and services you sell locally. The GST collected is called Output Tax.
- you can claim back GST paid on your business purchases (e.g: ingredients and materials). This is called Input Tax.
- you have to file GST returns. If Output Tax is more than Input Tax, you have to pay the difference to IRAS. If Input Tax is more than Output Tax, you will be refunded by IRAS.
