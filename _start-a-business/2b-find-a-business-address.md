## Step 2: Find a business address

#### Running a business from home

If you're running your business from home, you may apply for the Home Office Scheme with [HDB](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/home-business/home-office-scheme){:target="_blank"} for HDB properties or [URA](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Home-Business/Home-Office-Scheme){:target="_blank"} for private residential properties. Once approved, you may register your residential address as the business address. 

Alternatively, you can register an Alternate Address (at a fee of $40) to maintain your privacy. The Alternate Address will be shown on public records instead of your personal residential address.

#### Using commercial space

If you're running your business from a commercial space, you will need to check the allowable uses of your desired location on [URA Space](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/){:target="_blank"}. If your business activities are not allowed there, you may apply for planning permission to approve your intended use.
