#### Step 2: Find a business address

If you're running your business from home, you may apply for the Home Office Scheme with [HDB](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/home-business/home-offce-scheme){:target="_blank"} for HDB properties or [URA](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Home-Business/Home-Office-Scheme){:target="_blank"} for private residential properties.

If you're running your business from a commercial space, you will need to check the [allowed uses](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/){:target="_blank"} of your desired location. If your business activities are not allowed there, you may need to apply for approval.
