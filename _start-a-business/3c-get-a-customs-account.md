#### Get a Customs Account

If you wish to import or export goods in and out of Singapore, you will need to activate your Customs Account and apply for a customs permit. After that, you may appoint a Declaring Agent to apply for customs permits on your behalf [here]().

Imported goods are subject to GST and/or duty payment. Examples include:
