## Getting a Customs account

If you wish to import goods from overseas into Singapore or export goods out of Singapore, you will need to <a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/registering-to-trade/quick-guide-on-registration-matters" target="_blank" style="color:#037e8a">activate your Customs Account</a> first. After doing so, you may appoint a Declaring Agent to <a href="https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/login.portal" target="_blank" style="color:#037e8a">apply for customs permits</a> (import/export) via TradeNet on your behalf.

Imported goods are subject to GST and/or duty payment. A customs permit is required to account for the import and tax payment of the goods.

Example of dutiable goods include:
* Intoxicating liquors
* Tobacco products
* Motor vehicles
* Petroleum products
