## Register your business

#### 5. Register your business

To register your business, there are 2 ways you can go about doing so. You may either:

(1) <a href="https://google.com.sg" target="_blank" style="color:#037e8a">login</a> using your SingPass or CorpPass to submit the application online. All proposed partners/managers will need to endorse their consent online via BizFile+ first before the application can be processed by ACRA, or

(2) engage the services of a registered filing agent (e.g. law firm, accounting firm or corporate secretarial firm) to submit an online application on your behalf.

**Unique Entity Number (UEN) and Free Business Profile (BP)**

Upon successful registration of your new business, your business will be issued a Unique Entity Number (UEN). The UEN is your business' unique identification number that will be used in all interactions with government agencies.

A <a href="https://www.acra.gov.sg/about-bizfile/updates-and-announcements/provision-of-free-business-profiles" target="_blank" style="color:#037e8a">free copy of Business Profile</a> for your business will be emailed to the person filing the application upon successful registration of your business.
