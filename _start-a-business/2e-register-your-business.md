#### Step 5: Register your business

There are two ways to register your business:

1) Log in with your SingPass or CorpPass to submit the application online. All proposed partners/managers will need to endorse their consent online via BizFile+ first before the application can be processed by ACRA, or

2) Engage a registered filing agent (e.g: law firm, accounting firm or corporate secretarial firm) to submit an online application on your behalf.

<u>Register a domain name</u>
<br>After you have registered your business with ACRA, you can [register a domain name](https://www.sgnic.sg/){:target="_blank"} (ending with ".com.sg" or ".sg") with any of the authorised registrars accredited by the Singapore Network Information Centre (SGNIC).

With the [ACRA SME Programme](https://www.sgnic.sg/smepromotion-2.html){:target="_blank"} you will save at least S$30 for the first year of registration for one domain name ending with ".com.sg" or ".sg".

<u>Unique Entity Number (UEN) and Business Profile</u>
<br>Upon successful registration of your new business, your business will be issued a Unique Entity Number (UEN). The UEN is your business' unique identification number that will be used in all transactions with government agencies.

A [free copy of Business Profile](https://www.acra.gov.sg/about-bizfile/updates-and-announcements/provision-of-free-business-profiles){:target="_blank"} for your business will be emailed to the person filing the application upon successful registration of your business.
