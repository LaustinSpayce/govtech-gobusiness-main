**Sole Proprietors**
A Sole proprietorship is run by only one business owner and it is the simplest form of business structure. While a sole proprietor has complete control over the business and its operations, at the same time, he is also personally responsible for all debts and legal actions against the business.

**Partnerships**
A Partnership is similar to a sole proprietor, except it is formed by 2 or more partners.

**Limited Partnership (LP)**
A LP is a partnership consisting of a minimum of two partners, with at least one general partner and one limited partner and does not have a separate legal entity from the partners. A general partner is responsible for the actions of the LP and is liable for all debts and obligations of the LP. A limited partner of the LP is not liable for debts and obligations of the LP beyond his agreed contribution, provided he does not take part in the management of the LP.

**Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)**
An LLP is a type of business structure in which two or more partners incorporate an entity separate from themselves. A partner of the LLP cannot be held personally liable for the wrongful commission or omission of any other partners. Thus, every partner is personally responsible for any liabilities that arise due to his act of commission, omission, or negligence. 

**Local Company**
A local company is a business entity incorporated in Singapore. A company has the right to own property, has perpetual succession and can sue or be sued in its own name. Companies have different setups and are distinguished by the company type e.g. private company limited by shares, exempt private company, public company limited by shares and public company limited by guarantee. The most common and most preferred type of entity among entrepreneurs in Singapore is the Private Limited Company
