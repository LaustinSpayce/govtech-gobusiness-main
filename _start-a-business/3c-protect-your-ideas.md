## Protect your ideas

Your inventions, designs and representations of your brand are Intellectual Property (IP) assets that can be protected. Having a strong IP portfolio can open up commercial opportunities for your business such as research & development (R&D) partnerships, securing investments, licensing and franchising. Whether you are a budding entrepreneur, a start-up, a SME or an MNC, take time to consider the best way to manage IP for your business growth. 

Common forms of IP are trade marks (representation of your brands), patents (your inventions) and designs. Click [here](/images/start/protect_your_ideas.jpg){:target="_blank"} to find out more. 

A good time to protect your IP is before launching your product or service, so that no one can take advantage of your IP without your permission.
