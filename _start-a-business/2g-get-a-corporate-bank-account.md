## Key steps to start

#### 7. Get a corporate bank account

Opening a corporate bank account is a must if you have registered a company or LLP.

Even if youâ€™re running a sole proprietorship, a business bank account allows you to keep your business assets and expenses separate from your own personal savings. It also helps you track your business cash inflows and outflows, which will come in handy during tax season.
