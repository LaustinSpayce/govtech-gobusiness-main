      There are 2 schemes you can consider if you intend to operate your business from home. The Home-Based Small Scale Business Scheme is for non-registered businesses while the Home Office scheme is for ACRA-registered businesses.
  - title: Home-Based Small Scale Business Scheme
    content: |
      This scheme is for non-registered businesses conducting home-based business activities such as sewing work and baking at home. You should wholly own and operate this business without any employees. The activities should not materially affect the use of the premises as a residential unit and shall not cause disturbance to other residents in the neighbourhood.

      **Criteria for Home-Based Businesses**
      1. No person outside the household is to be employed.
      2. No external advertisement/business signboard is to be displayed.
      3. No extraneous traffic is introduced to the site.
      4. No noise, smoke, smell, effluent or dust nuisances or danger should be posed to the surrounding residents.
      5. No loading and unloading of goods by vans and trucks.
      6.The activities must comply with the rules and regulations of other authorities.
      7. HDB flats cannot be used for business registration. The use of a private residential premises address for business registration does not require planning permission, provided there is no material change of use of the residential premises.

      As long as the criteria are fulfilled, you do not need to seek any approval from HDB or URA to run your business from home for your non-registered business. You can find the full criteria and guidelines from [HDB](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/home-business/homebased-small-scale-business-scheme){:target="_blank"} or [URA](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Home-Business/Home-Based-Businesses){:target="_blank"}.
