  - title: Home-Based Small Scale Business Scheme
    content: |
      This scheme is for non-registered businesses conducting home-based business activities such as sewing work and baking at home. You should wholly own and operate this business without any employees. The activities should not materially affect the use of the premises as a residential unit and shall not cause disturbance to other residents in the neighbourhood.

      **Criteria for Home-Based Businesses**
      1. No person outside the household is to be employed.
      2. No external advertisement/business signboard is to be displayed.
      3. No extraneous traffic is introduced to the site.
      4. No noise, smoke, smell, effluent or dust nuisances or danger should be posed to the surrounding residents.
      5. No loading and unloading of goods by vans and trucks.
      6. The activities must comply with the rules and regulations of other authorities.
      7. HDB flats cannot be used for business registration. The use of a private residential premises address for business registration does not require planning permission, provided there is no material change of use of the residential premises.

      As long as the criteria are fulfilled, you do not need to seek any approval from HDB or URA to run your business from home for your non-registered business. You can find the full criteria and guidelines from [HDB](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/home-business/homebased-small-scale-business-scheme){:target="_blank"} or [URA](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Home-Business/Home-Based-Businesses){:target="_blank"}.

## Overview

If you're starting a business in Singapore, the first question to consider is whether you need to register it.

Anybody looking to carry out any activity for profit on an ongoing basis must register a business with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), unless you meet the following criteria for exemption:

 - You use your full name, as per your NRIC, as your business name.
 - You and your partner(s) use your full names, as per your NRIC, as your business name

Do note that if you add descriptive words to your name (eg: Flowers by Tan Mei Ling), you must register the business. There are other exemptions and the full list can be found [here](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/BNRA2014?ProvIds=pr4-#pr4-){:target="_blank"}.

#### Benefits of registering a business

There are several benefits of registering a business with ACRA. Here are some of them:

- The public can easily verify information about your business and its owners
- The public can easily identify, find and transact with your business
- You get to participiate in government tenders and secure intellectual property or patents for new products and technology
- Your business gets access to Government funding, such as Enterprise Singapore grants

In addition, if you incorporate a company or set up a limited liability partnership (instead of registering a sole proprietorship or partnership), your personal and business finances are kept separate. This means that in the event that your business is sued, your personal liabilities are limited and you do not risk losing your personal assets.
