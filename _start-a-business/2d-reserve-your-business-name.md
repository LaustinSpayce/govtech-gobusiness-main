#### Step 4: Reserve your business name

After checking your desired name with the Name Search tool, you can reserve it for up to 120 days before registering your business. After the reservation period, the name will be released.

To reserve your name, you will need to provide the SSIC code for your business activities. Different business activities each have a different 5-digit SSIC code. To find out your SSIC code, use our [SSIC Search Tool](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/ngbbizfileinternet/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pages/TransactionMain.jspx?selectedETransId=G016&_afrLoop=34024712123555599&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null&_adf.ctrl-state=1atq4iub9c_1#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26selectedETransId%3DG016%26_afrLoop%3D34024712123555599%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D1atq4iub9c_5){:target="_blank"}.
