## Protect your ideas

Your inventions, designs and representations of your brand are Intellectual Property (IP) assets that can be protected. Having a strong IP portfolio can open up commercial opportunities for your business such as licensing and franchising. Whether you are a budding entrepreneur, a start-up, a SME or an MNC, take time to consider the best way to manage IP for your business growth. 

Common forms of IP are trade marks (representation of your brands), patents (your inventions) and designs. Click [here](/images/start/protect_your_ideas.jpg){:target="_blank"} to find out more. 

Protect your IP before launching your product or service, so that no one can take advantage of your IP without your permission. You can [book a complimentary consultation on IP strategies](www.ipos.gov.sg/e-services/e-appointment/make-an-appointment){:target="_blank"} with Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS).
