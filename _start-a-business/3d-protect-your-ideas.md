#### Protect your ideas

Your inventions, designs and representations of your brand are common forms of Intellectual Property (IP), such as trade marks and patents. Having a strong IP portfolio can open up opportunities for your business such as licensing and franchising.

A good time to protect your IP is before launching your product or service, to avoid IP theft. You can book a complimentary consultation on IP strategies [here](/images/start/protect_your_ideas.jpg){:target="_blank"}.
