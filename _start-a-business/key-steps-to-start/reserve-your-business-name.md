![Reserve Biz Name](/images/start/StartSJ_ReserveName.jpg)

Decide on a name for your business and use our e-Adviser for Starting a Business to:

- check if there are similar business names or trade marks, and if it's available as a username on Facebook/Instagram/YouTube/Twitter.
- receive a guide and find out what additional approvals are required to get your business started.

{% include button.html text="Go to e-Adviser for Starting a Business" src="https://eadviser.g2b.sg/startabusiness" type="primary" %}

Avoid names which are:

- identical to another business' name
- undesirable (eg: vulgar, obscene or offensive)
- prohibited (e.g: Temasek)

You may submit an appeal if your name application has been rejected and/or you have a valid reason to use the name which is you have the necessary approval for names that are identical or prohibited. You will need to upload the supporting documents to support your name appeal.

To improve your chances of a successful application, read the [ACRA business name guidelines](https://www.acra.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/how-to-guides/lodging-complaints/acra's-policy-statement-on-the-treatment-of-business-names-and-name-complaints.pdf){:target="_blank"} for more details.

### Review of applications by Referral Authorities

Certain names or business activities require approval from the relevant government agencies (Referral Authorities). For example, names containing 'hospital', 'clinic', 'surgery', 'healthcare' will require approval from the Ministry of Health. In such cases, the application may take between 14 days to 60 days.

You can find the [list of Referral Authorities here](https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/before-you-start/referral-authorities){:target="_blank"}.

### Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC)

**What is SSIC and why do i need it for my business?**

The Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) is the national standard to classify the business activities of firms. It is a code assigned to classify your business activities carried out in Singapore. These codes are used for service delivery by government agencies and in the compilation and analysis of industry statistics for policy and business planning purposes. Each SSIC category comprises a 5-digit code and description of the business activity.

When reserving your business name, you will need to provide the SSIC code(s) that best describes your business activities. To find out your SSIC code, use our [e-Adviser for Starting a Business](https://eadviser.g2b.sg/startabusiness){:target="_blank"}. A complete list of the SSIC codes can be found [here](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/standards_and_classifications/industrial_classification/ssic2020-alphabetical-index.xlsx){:target="_blank"}.
