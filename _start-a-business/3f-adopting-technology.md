#### Adopt digital solutions

Areas you can use technology in include:
- Online selling/marketing
- Connecting point of sale (POS) system to accounting software
- E-invoicing and digital payment with PayNow Corporate
- Remote working
- Record keeping and accounting

If you are looking to adopt IT solutions or equipment to enhance processes, you can apply for the [Productivity Solutions Grant](/productivity-solutions-grant/){:target="_blank"} to get up to 80% funding support.

With [Start Digital Pack](https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/smes-go-digital/start-digital-pack){:target="_blank"}, you can use digital solutions such as Xero and Expensify at no cost for at least six months with a minimum 18-month contract period. Certain accounting software can also file tax returns and financial statements directly to ACRA and IRAS, so you can do this without engaging professional services.
