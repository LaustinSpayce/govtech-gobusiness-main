## Finding a business address

#### 4. Finding a business address

If you like to run your business from home, you may apply for the Home Office Scheme with either <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/home-business/home-offce-scheme" target="_blank" style="color:#037e8a">HDB</a> or <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Home-Business/Home-Office-Scheme" target="_blank" style="color:#037e8a">URA</a>, depending on whether you stay in a HDB property or private residential property. Once approved, you may use your residential address as the business address when registering your business.

If you like to run your business from a commercial space, you may wish to check on the <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/" target="_blank" style="color:#037e8a">allowable uses</a> of the shortlisted premises to find out if any planning permission is required to change the approved use of that premises to your intended use.
