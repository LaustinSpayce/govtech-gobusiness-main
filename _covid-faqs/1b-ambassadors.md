    content: |
      Safe Distancing Ambassadors wear a lanyard and a red polo shirt with the words “Safe Distancing Ambassador” on the back.
  - title: I do not agree with the decision of the Safe Distancing Ambassador. What can I do about it?
    content: |
      The decision of the Safe Distancing Ambassadors and enforcement officers is final. Verbal warnings will be issued and if businesses continue to break the rules, stricter enforcement measures, including fines and suspending business operations, will be used.
  - title: How do we verify the identity of enforcement officers? What do they do?
    content: |
      Enforcement officers from various agencies including the Singapore Police Force, National Environment Agency, National Parks Board and Land Transport Authority, are given a letter of appointment by the Ministry of Health. You can verify their identities by asking to see the letter.

      They enforce safe distancing measures and control order regulations, by conducting inspections. These officers can also issue offenders (businesses or individuals) a warning letter or a Notice of Offence, which includes the required fine amount and details of the offence.
  - title: Are we required to pay fines to enforcement officers on the spot?
    content: |
      No, offenders will not be asked to pay their fines on the spot.
  - title: I have been issued a fine and/or an order to suspend business operations. How do I make an appeal?
    content: |
      The decision of the enforcement officers is final. In particular, their decision and any accompanying relevant authorities’ stop orders shall override the exemption from suspension of activities issued. You are reminded to pay the fine by the date stated in the Notice of Offence and refrain from committing any further offences to comply with the law at all times.
  - title: I am issued a fine. How do I make payment?
    content: |
      You can refer to the Notice of Offence issued to you for payment instructions.

      Enforcement officers will not collect fines on the spot. The penalties for breaches will be issued to individuals or businesses in the form of composition letters, which will state the follow-up actions required.
