    - title: How do I know if my company is allowed to operate? 
      content: |
        Your company is allowed to operate if your company’s activities are in MTI’s list of permitted services [here](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/images/covid/Permitted%20Services%20(11%20May).pdf){:target="_blank"}. Businesses in this list do not need to apply to MTI for exemption before operating.  

        If you cannot recall your company’s primary SSIC code or are unsure of the classification of your business activity, you can visit [Bizfile+](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} and login with your Singpass to retrieve your primary SSIC code. Thereafter, you can check this against the list of permitted services. 

    - title: If my company’s activities belong to the list of permitted services, will I be able to operate all my business functions?
      content: |
        If your company has other business functions or services that are not in the list of permitted services, these other business functions or services should be suspended until further notice.

    - title: I operate multiple business activities and have more than one Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) code tagged to my business. Which code should I refer to?
      content: |
        You should refer to the SSIC code for your primary business activity and check it against the list of permitted services that can operate [here](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/permittedlist/){:target="_blank"}.

    - title: I have more than one Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) code tagged to my business. If my primary activity does not fall under the list of permitted services, but my secondary activity falls under the list of permitted services, will I still be allowed to operate? 
      content: |
        No. You may operate only if the SSIC code for your primary business activity falls within the list of permitted services. However, if you intend to only carry out the secondary activity (and not the primary activity) which falls within the list of permitted services, you may submit an application for General Exemption [here](https://foodservices.gobusiness.gov.sg/exemptions/login){:target="_blank"}.

    - title: What is the penalty if my company is found operating when we are not allowed to do so?

    - title: I have checked the list of permitted services against my primary SSIC code and I am sure I am allowed to operate. Why is my business resumption status not reflected as “permitted”? 
      content: |
        If your primary SSIC code falls into the list of permitted services and you have not changed your primary SSIC code recently, please write to <covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg>{:target="_blank"}  for assistance.

    - title: What if my business activities do not fall under what is stated as permitted services for the SSIC code of my company’s primary business activity?
      content: |
        Your company may operate the business activities that fall within the list of permitted services. 

        If your company’s business activities do not fall within the permitted services for the SSIC code of your company’s primary business activity, these activities should remain suspended until further notice. You will need to apply for a General Exemption.

    - title: I am unable to declare/submit my manpower details. What should I do? 
      content: |
        If your business has a ‘Permitted’ status, you are no longer required to submit manpower details and hence will not be able to see the “Submit Manpower” button on the portal. If you are operating on a General Exemption approval but are facing issues with manpower submission, please write to MTI at <covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg>{:target="_blank"}

        Please also note that there may be conditions imposed on the approval of your general exemption. These conditions will be indicated in your official email notification of approval.

Any significant changes to the manpower count or manpower details which you had declared/submitted earlier should be updated as soon as possible.

    - title: What happens if I do not receive an acknowledgement email after I have declared my manpower details? 
      content: |
        If you have not received an acknowledgement email, your email address may be inaccurately captured on our system. For applicants with a Corppass account, kindly login to [GoBusiness portal](https://foodservices.gobusiness.gov.sg/exemptions/login){:target="_blank"} to verify that your email address is accurately reflected.

    - title: Under what circumstances do I need to update my manpower declaration? Do I need to do so if there is a change in the number of employees/workers working on-site? 
      content: |
        Yes, you should update your manpower declaration if there are any changes to (i) the total number of employees/workers working on-site and (ii) the maximum number of workers on-site at any given time.

      content: |
        You may change and resubmit your manpower declaration up to 5 times a day. 

    - title: When I login to the system to declare/submit my manpower details, I notice that “the number of employees/workers under my employment” reflected is incorrect. What should I do? 
      content: |
        For applications with ‘Permitted’ status, ‘N/A’ will be reflected under the ‘No. of manpower onsite’, since manpower declaration will no longer be required for ‘Permitted applications from 5 Apr 2021. 

        For applications with ‘Approved’ status, the employment records are accurate as at Dec 2020. We allow for reasonable fluctuations to this number. Therefore, you should continue to declare your manpower details.

        However, should the numbers vary substantially, you should submit a copy of your manpower records with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and/or the Central Provident Fund (CPF) to MTI at <covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg>{:target="_blank"}.

    - title: I need to update the Ministry of Manpower of changes in my foreign workers’ particulars (e.g. residential address) during their employment. Where can I find more information about this? 
      content: |
        You can find more information [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/notify-mom-of-changes){:target="_blank"}. 

    - title: I have problems adding in more manpower details to my application. Why is it so? 
      content: |
        Depending on the status & conditions tagged to your exemption, each application is allotted a specific manpower quota. You will not be able to add more employees to your application once you have reached the allotted quota.  The cap on the number of employees that you are allowed to have on-site is necessary to minimise the movement of workers to and from work.  We are aware that this will be disruptive for businesses, but it is also essential in the fight against COVID-19.

    - title: I need more manpower on site to ensure the continuation of my business activities. What should I do? 
      content: |
        The cap on the number of manpower that you are allowed to have on-site is necessary to minimise the movement of employees to and from work.  Should you require additional manpower, please submit an application for Additional Manpower [here](https://go.gov.sg/covidbusinessresumptions){:target="_blank"}. Do note that the application will be subject to assessment by the respective agencies.

      content: |
        From 1 July 2020, businesses that falls under the Marine & Offshore and Process sectors will be required to submit details of the employees/workers [here](https://foodservices.gobusiness.gov.sg/exemptions/login){:target="_blank"}. This submission of manpower details is required to facilitate information updates for the AccessCode on the SGWorkPass app, including the approval to work and the requirement for regular swabbing. Failure to do so will cause the employee’s SGWorkPass AccessCode status to reflect as “Red”. 

    - title: What manpower details must I submit, and from when should I be submitting? 
      content: |
        You will need to submit the FIN/NRICs of your workers/employees that are working on-site, and the maximum number of workers on site at any given time. If your workers are working on-site, you will also need to provide the address of the work premises, and indicate whether the work premises is a production site (e.g. shipyards/ production plant) or non-production site (e.g. other workplaces/ office premise). Please note that workers deployed at production sites will be required to undergo **Rostered Routine Testing (RRT)**.

        For workers and employees that are working from home, who subsequently need to go back to site for specific reasons, you will need to submit their FIN details. 

        Only the details for Singapore Citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents, Employment Pass Holders, S Pass Holders and Work Permit Holders are required to be submitted. All other non-MOM work pass holders (e.g long-term visitor pass or ICA work pass) need not be submitted. 

    - title: What is considered a production site? 
      content: |
        Production site is defined as areas where shipbuilding/ship repair, process maintenance and construction activities are carried out. Examples of production sites includes shipyards, process plants, refineries and fabrication workshops.   

    - title: If my office is located within my production site, how should I indicate so in my manpower submission?
      content: |
        If the office staff do not come into contact with the production site workers and are clearly segregated, you can indicate your premises as a non-production site. 

    - title: If my worker/employees are deployed across multiple sites, how do I indicate so when submitting my manpower details? 
      content: |
        You will need to click on the “Add Premises” button to key in the details of your workers/employees that are deployed across multiple sites. 

    - title: If my company has multiple work premises, do I need to submit manpower details for all my workers across all the different work premises? 
      content: |
        You will need to click on the “Add Premises” button to key in the details of all your company’s work premises. 

    - title: Will I receive any additional notification to know whether my worker/employee is approved to work on-site? How do I know if my submitted manpower is approved to work on-site? 
      content: |
        Upon submission of the manpower details, you will receive an email acknowledgement. The AccessCode on SGWorkPass app will determine whether your submitted manpower is allowed to work on site. The AccessCode will factor in a few parameters, namely:

        - Worker’s health status 
        
        - Worker’s place of residence is COVID-free
        
        - Worker’s approval to work
        
        - Download and activate latest version of TraceTogether

        Workers with a “green” AccessCode will be allowed to work on-site.

    - title: By when should I submit my manpower details to know whether my worker/employee will be allowed to work on-site? 
      content: |
        You will need to submit your manpower details by 1730 hours, for your worker/employees’ AccessCode to be updated by 2359 hours on the following day via the SGWorkPass app. 

    - title: What happens if the employee/workers’ AccessCode is not updated? 
      content: |
        If you have submitted your manpower details by 1730 hours, your employee/workers’ AccessCode will only be updated by 2359 hours on the following day. If you require assistance, please write to MTI at <covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg>{:target="_blank"}.

    - title: When do I need to update my manpower details submission? 
      content: |
        You will need to update your manpower details as soon as there is a change in the specific workers required to work on-site, as this will affect arrangements for your workers’ regular swab tests.

    - title: My SSIC code is in Marine/Offshore/Process but that is not the nature of my work. Do I still have to submit my manpower details? 
      content: |
        Manpower details are required for companies utilising Marine Shipyard or Process manpower quota as defined under MOM. These details are required to ensure that your workers’ SG WorkPass app AccessCode reflects their approval to be deployed for work and to facilitate arrangement for regular swab tests. 

    - title: I have successfully submitted my manpower details but the Workpass app still comes out as red. Can I proceed to deploy my workers?
      content: |
        The AccessCode factors in a few parameters, namely:

        - Worker’s health status 

        - Worker’s place of residence is COVID-free

        - Worker’s approval to work

        - Download and activate latest version of TraceTogether

        Only workers with a “green” AccessCode should be deployed to work on-site.
