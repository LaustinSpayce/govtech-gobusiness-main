  - title: I am unable to declare/submit my manpower details. What should I do?
    content: |
      If the status of your general exemption or business resumption is not reflected as “approved” or “permitted”, you will be unable to declare your manpower details. If you require assistance, please write to MTI at <a href = "mailto: covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg">covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg</a>.

      Please also note that there may be conditions imposed on the approval of your general exemption. These conditions will be indicated in your official email notification of approval.

  - title: What manpower details must companies declare/submit? How do I declare/submit my manpower details?
    content: |
      Companies on the permitted list are not required to submit the NRIC/FIN for their workers. They will only need to declare their manpower numbers (i.e. total number of manpower on-site and the maximum number of manpower on-site at any given time).

      For applicants with a CorpPass account, please login <a href="https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/exemptions" target="_blank">here</a>. Thereafter, please click on the button “submit manpower”, which will be made available only for permitted business resumptions/ general exemptions.

      Businesses who fail to submit the manpower details within 2 weeks of resuming operations will be in breach of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. First-time offenders found operating will face a fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Subsequent offences may face a fine of up to $20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.

      Specific manpower declaration requirements for the Marine & Offshore and Process sectors can be found here.
  - title: My business is on the permitted services list. Why do I still need to declare my manpower details?
    content: |
      The Multi-Ministry TaskForce announced on 19 May 2020 that Circuit Breaker measures will be gradually eased from 2 June 2020, and businesses will be allowed to resume activities in a phased manner.

      As more workers go back to work, we need to ensure that businesses resume operations in a safe way. Hence, businesses that are allowed to resume operations are required to declare their manpower details.

      Businesses that fail to submit their manpower details within 2 weeks of resuming operations will be in breach of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. First-time offenders found operating will face a fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Subsequent offences may face a fine of up to $20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.

      If your company has not submitted on-site manpower details before and is not operating on-site, please click on the “declare 0 button” to declare “0” manpower working on-site.

      If you had already submitted on-site manpower details previously but are now ceasing on-site operations, click on the “reset to 0” button under the field “total number of manpower working on-site” to declare “0” manpower working on-site.

  - title: What happens if I do not receive an acknowledgement email after I have declared my manpower details?
    content: |
      If you have not received an acknowledgement email, your email address may be inaccurately captured on our system. For applicants with a CorpPass account, kindly login here to verify that your email address is accurately reflected.

      You will be able to update your email address if needed. All changes will be reflected immediately. You will also be able to check whether your declaration has been captured. You should resubmit the declaration if it has not been captured.
  - title: Under what circumstances do I need to update my manpower declaration? Do I need to do so if there is a change in the number of employees/workers working on-site?

      Yes, you should update your manpower declaration if there are any changes to (i) the total number of employees/workers working on-site and (ii) the maximum number of workers on-site at any given time.

  - title: When I login to the system to declare/submit my manpower details, I notice that “the number of employees/workers under my employment” reflected is incorrect. What should I do?
    content: |
      The employment records are accurate as at Feb 2020. We allow for reasonable fluctuations to this number. Therefore, you should continue to declare your manpower details.

      However, should the numbers vary substantially, you should submit a copy of your manpower records with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and/or the Central Provident Fund (CPF) to MTI at <a href = "mailto: covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg.">covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg</a> .
  - title: I need to update the Ministry of Manpower of changes in my foreign workers’ particulars (e.g. residential address) during their employment. Where can I find more information about this?

      You can find more information <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/notify-mom-of-changes" target="_blank">here</a>.
  - title: I have problems adding in more manpower details to my application. Why is it so?
    content: |
      Depending on the status & conditions tagged to your exemption, each application is allotted a specific manpower quota. You will not be able to add more employees to your application once you have reached the allotted quota. The cap on the number of employees that you are allowed to have on-site is necessary to minimise the movement of workers to and from work. We are aware that this will be disruptive for businesses, but it is also essential in the fight against COVID-19.
