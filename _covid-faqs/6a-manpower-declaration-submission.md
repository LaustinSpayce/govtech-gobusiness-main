        Yes. The guide for declaration/submission of manpower details can be found <a href="https://file.go.gov.sg/essentialmanpowerguide25sep.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
    - title: How do I know if I need to declare/submit my manpower details?

        All businesses that are allowed to resume operations, or have received an approval for their General Exemption application, are required to do so.

        You can refer to the full list of permitted services allowed to resume operations <a href="images/covid/Permittedserviceslist2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
    - title: I am unable to declare/submit my manpower details. What should I do?
      content:  |
        If the status of your general exemption or business resumption is not reflected as “approved” or “permitted”, you will be unable to declare your manpower details. If you require assistance, please write to MTI at <a href = "mailto: covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg">covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg</a>.

        Please also note that there may be conditions imposed on the approval of your general exemption. These conditions will be indicated in your official email notification of approval. Alternatively, you may also login <a href="https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/exemptions" target="_blank">here</a> to check your exemption application for any conditions to your approval.  
    - title: How long do I need to keep declaring/submitting my manpower details? Do I need to update this information on a daily basis whenever there are changes to my manpower count?
      content:  |
        You will be expected to ensure that your manpower details are updated for the entire duration of the phased resumption of businesses. Any significant changes to the manpower count or manpower details which you had declared/submitted earlier should be updated as soon as possible.
