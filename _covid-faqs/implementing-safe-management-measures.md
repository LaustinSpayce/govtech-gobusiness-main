  - title: What are the key changes for Safe Management Measures at the workplace that will take effect from 5 April 2021?
    content: |
      **Work from home (WFH)**

      The revised WFH requirement is that no more than 75% of employees who can WFH can be at the workplace at any point in time, from 50% previously. There is no longer a limit on the proportion of an individual employee’s working time that can be spent at the workplace. The mandatory split team requirement will also be removed.

      **Work-related events**

      Employer-organised social activities will be allowed, subject to the same rules as the community; i.e. gatherings of no more than 8 persons (and no multiple groups of 8 persons). Team bonding activities, for instance, will be allowed but only to a group of 8 persons. There is no change to the current provision for work-related events such as townhalls and workplan seminars, which remains capped at 50 persons.

  - title: Is it possible for my business to resume operations earlier if I have implemented all Safe Management Measures at my workplace?   
    content: |
      To prevent the re-emergence of community cases, we will need to open the economy gradually, and not all at once. In general, sectors that allow us to trade with the world and access critical supplies will start first. Sectors that attract high traffic and social interactions will have to wait and put in place additional safe measures before restarting progressively.

      You can resume business operations only if your company falls under MTI’s list of activities and services that can resume operations, and your company has implemented all required Safe Management Measures at your workplace.
