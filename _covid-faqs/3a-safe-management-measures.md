    - title: Are Safe Management Measures mandatory, and what actions will Ministry of Manpower (MOM) take against businesses that do not implement them?
      content:  |        
        Action taken by MOM and sector agencies depends on the areas of non-compliance. For workplaces that severely lack Safe Management Measures, employers will be ordered to stop operations at the workplace. They will have to take steps to ensure that Safe Management Measures are in place before operations can resume.

        Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, failure to comply with Safe Management Measures is punishable with a fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment of up to 6 months, or both. Repeated offence is punishable with a fine of up to $20,000, imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both.
    - title: Who enforces the requirements and how can I verify the identity of enforcement officers inspecting my workplace?

        Enforcement action may be taken by any of the following persons under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act:

        - A police officer
        - A Health Officer appointed under section 4(1)(a) or (b) of the Infectious Diseases Act
