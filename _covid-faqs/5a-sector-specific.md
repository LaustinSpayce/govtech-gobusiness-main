    - title: Are non-corporate entities (eg. clubs, societies, charities, Social Service Agencies, co-operative societies) also allowed to resume work-related events?
      content:  |        
        Yes, all permitted enterprises are allowed to resume work-related events of up to 50 persons at their own workplaces or premises, and at third-party venues. Respective sectoral advisories and safe management measures continue to apply.

    - title: Are fundraising events allowed to take place?
      content:  |    
        Yes, fundraising events may take place at the organiser’s own premises or third-party venues, with up to 50 persons per event.

        Fundraising activities that are not standalone fundraising events but are conducted as part of the course of other activities should follow the guidelines and safe management measures set for the primary activity. For example, fundraising carried out by commercial participators in the course of their retail business should follow the prevailing guidelines in place for retail activities. Similarly, the collection of offerings/tithes during religious services should follow the prevailing guidelines for the conduct of religious services. For more information, please refer <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/safe-management-measures" target="_blank">here</a>.
    - title: I have submitted Safe Management plans for my religious organisation (RO) during Phase One. Do I need to submit another plan for Phase Two?
      content:  |    
        Yes. As Phase Two involves the gradual resumption of congregational and worship services, as well as other non-congregational worship activities, all ROs are required to submit their Safe Management Plan, including manpower deployment, at least 3 days before resumption of Phase Two activities. ROs who have already submitted their safe management plan in Phase One only need to submit a shorter plan to cover the additional safe management measures for Phase Two activities. Please refer to <a href="https://www.cpro.gov.sg/" target="_blank">www.cpro.gov.sg</a> for details.

        ROs requesting deviations from the parameters set out in MCCY’s 18 Jun 2020 advisory on resumption of more religious activities in Phase Two will require MCCY’s approval before proceeding with their activities.

        MCCY will conduct enforcement checks and action will be taken against ROs who do not comply with the relevant guidelines, including the cessation of operations.
    - title: My religious organisation (RO) was not open during Phase One and I did not submit my Phase One Safe Management Plans. Am I allowed to proceed with Phase Two activities?
      content:  |
        - Your RO has to submit a Safe Management Plan, including manpower deployment, at least 3 days before commencing Phase Two activities.
        - ROs who wish to deviate from the parameters set out in MCCY’s 18 Jun 2020 advisory on resumption of more religious activities in Phase Two will require MCCY’s approval before proceeding with their activities.
        - MCCY will conduct enforcement checks and action will be taken against ROs who do not comply with the relevant guidelines, including the cessation of operations.
