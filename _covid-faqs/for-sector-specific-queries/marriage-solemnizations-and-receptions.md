  - title: What are the latest guidelines given the heightened situation?
    content: |
      In light of the latest COVID-19 situation in Singapore, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has announced a tightening of safe management measures for events, including marriage solemnizations and weddings receptions. From 8 May to 30 May 2021, marriage solemnizations and weddings receptions at external venues (excluding homes) will be subject to the following limits:

      |Activity|Max No. of Attendees, including Bride and Groom (Without Pre-Event Testing)|Max No. of Attendees, including Bride and Groom (With Pre-Event Testing)|
      |Solemnizations|1-50|51-250 Pre-Event Testing required for bride and groom only, if they are unvaccinated|
      |Wedding Receptions|1-50|51 -250 Pre-Event Testing required for all unvaccinated attendees|
  - title: Why are measures tightened so quickly?
    content: |
      The local and global COVID-19 situation continues to evolve. Several countries continue to experience a resurgence of cases and the emergence of new virus variants which have also been found in Singapore. The number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and unlinked community cases has also continued to increase, signalling undetected community transmissions that could rapidly escalate into another major outbreak if not adequately contained in a timely manner. The tightened measures will help to reduce the risk of transmission and of large clusters forming.

  - title: 3.	Can an exception be made for solemnizations and weddings? Why are the requirements for weddings and solemnizations stricter than other types of events (e.g. MICE)?
    content: |
      Due to the intimate and social nature of marriage celebrations, there is a higher chance of interaction among attendees. There is also a higher likelihood of attendees interacting while unmasked, at wedding receptions. Hence, the potential risks of transmission are higher than at business or religious events, even if those are larger.

      We seek the cooperation of everyone in adhering to the prevailing safe management measures to keep you and your loved ones safe.

  - title: 4.	My wedding reception is between 8 May to 30 May and I have invited 51 to 100 guests. As PET is now required for my guests, where and how can my guests get tested?
    content: |
      Please click [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/list-of-covid-19-swab-providers) for a list of MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers.

  - title: Will the Government subsidise or pay for PET?
    content: |
      PET for all events, including solemnizations and receptions, will not be funded by the government; organisers or individuals are responsible for paying for their own tests.

  - title: My wedding is after 30 May 2021 (e.g. 6 Jun 2021), how many guests can I invite and will they be subject to PET?
    content: |
      These requirements are based on the current situation. The Government will monitor the situation closely, and depending on whether it improves, or worsens, will review the guidelines accordingly. Couples and wedding organisers can take reference from the prevailing requirements and should be prepared that the requirements may change at any point of time, given the dynamic COVID-19 situation.

  - title: Are vendors (e.g. hotels, restaurants) required to allow couples to cut to 50 pax without penalties?
    content: |
      This would be subject to the contractual agreements between vendors and the wedding couples. Given the dynamic COVID-19 situation, we hope all parties, including vendors and couples, can exercise flexibility and mutual understanding in adjusting their plans.

  - title: How many persons can I have at my solemnization ceremony?
    content: |
      **Places of residence**

      As of 8 May 2021, an individual must not permit to enter or remain in his or her place of residence more than 5 visitors on any single day. An exception is made for home solemnizations which are subject to the following limits:

      For solemnization ceremonies held in places of residence, the maximum number of attendees for solemnizations will be, including the wedding couple, (i) 10 persons or (ii) 5 visitors in addition to any residents to the home where the solemnization is held, whichever is higher. This cap excludes the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization (kept to a minimum). For example, if there are 6 persons currently living in your household, the 6 residents and an additional 5 visitors can attend a solemnization in your home. The total of 11 persons counts the wedding couple but excludes the solemnizer and vendors. Or if you live alone, you and 9 other persons, including the wedding couple, can attend a solemnization in your home, excluding the solemnizer and vendors.

      However, if a place of residence has 5 or more visitors attending a home solemnization (as guests or vendors), then the individual must not accept any more visitors that day to his or her place of residence.

      **External venues**

      For solemnization held in other external solemnization venues, such as places of worship or hotels, to the maximum number of attendees will be (a) 50 attendees (without PET), or (b) 51-250 persons (with PET), or the safe capacity of the venue, whichever is lower. For solemnizations involving between 101-250 attendees, PET is required for the wedding couple only.  Please refer to section X of the FAQs for details on the zoning requirements. This cap excludes the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization (kept to a minimum). Please check with your solemnization venue owner / operator on the number of attendees allowed and any other conditions to be met before making arrangements.

  - title: Are vendors (e.g. photographers, videographers, make-up artists, bridal studio) allowed to resume operations for solemnizations? Are they part of the guest limit?
    content: |
      Vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization must be on MTI’s permitted list of activities as reflected on the GoBusiness portal and must have made their manpower declarations to MTI within two weeks of resuming operations. These vendors can be excluded from the guest limit for your solemnization / reception but should be kept to a minimum.

  - title: Does the guest limit for in-person solemnizations include the interpreter?
    content: |
      No, the guest limit excludes the interpreter, Licensed Solemnizer, and vendors  engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization (kept to a minimum).

  - title: Can the bride and groom remove face masks for the solemnization ceremony? Can the bride and groom use face shields in place of face masks? Can the rest of the attendees be unmasked for photo-taking?
    content: |
      The bride and groom must use face masks or face shields throughout the solemnization process. In addition, they may remove their masks and/or face shields for key moments of the solemnization, which includes the exchanging of vows, rings, to kiss and during march-ins/outs. However, the bride and groom must maintain a 2-metre distance from the rest of the attendees of the solemnization whenever masks and face shields have been removed. All other attendees must have their masks on throughout the solemnization process<sup>6</sup>.

      Masks / face shields may be removed briefly for photo-taking, but must be put on immediately after photos.

      <sup>6</sup> Children aged twelve years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time, may wear a face shield as indicated in MOH’s Advisory of 1 Jun 2020 (“Guidance for Use of Masks and Face Shields”)

  - title: Can other accompanying parties remove their face masks during the march-in/out?
    content: |
      No. Only the bride and groom may remove their masks and/or face shields during march-ins/outs. All other attendees must have their masks on throughout the solemnization process.  

  - title: How long can our solemnization ceremony last?
    content: |
      For the safety of the bride, groom, and guests, the solemnization should be kept as brief as possible.

  - title: Will these measures, including the limit on the number of people, change in the future?
    content: |
      These guidelines are based on the current situation. The guidelines may change in future, depending on the COVID-19 situation at that point in time.

      You may wish to refer [here](http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19){:target="_blank"} for updates on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore.

accordion-a:
  - title: What is Pre-Event Testing (“PET”)?
    content: |
      A “Pre-Event Test” (PET) refers to a COVID-19 test taken by an attendee or patron who wishes to enter a premise where certain events, businesses, or activities are being held. This attendee or patron must obtain a negative COVID-19 test result within a specified period of time, before being allowed to enter the venue.

  - title: When is PET required for marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions?
    content: |
      a. For solemnizations involving 51 to 250 attendees, PET will be required for the unvaccinated wedding couple only.

      b. For wedding receptions involving 51 to 250 attendees, PET will be required for all unvaccinated attendees (including the wedding couple).

      c. If a solemnization and reception is held back-to-back, and consists of 51 to 250 attendees, PET is required for all unvaccinated attendees (including the wedding couple).

      Marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions involving 50 or fewer attendees do not require PET.

      The PET must be done: (i)	Before entry to the solemnization or wedding reception; and (ii) At most 24 hours before the end of the event.

      Organisers of solemnizations and wedding receptions should ensure that PET requirements are met for such events involving more than 50 attendees. PET for all events, including solemnizations and receptions, will not be funded by the government; organisers or individuals are responsible for paying for their own tests.

      Please refer to MOH’s guidelines at go.gov.sg/pet for more information on PET.

      All marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions will continue to be subject to the prevailing safe management measures, such as zonal/ time slot requirements and safe distancing rules.

  - title: What would exempt me/my guests from PET?
    content: |
      Please refer to MOH’s guidelines at [go.gov.sg/pet](https://go.gov.sg/pet) on individuals who are exempt from PET and acceptable exemption notices that must be shown to the wedding organiser to be allowed entry. Wedding organisers will have to check-in attendees for events requiring PET. PET status of the attendee is verified as part of SafeEntry check-in. Please refer to the Event Organiser’s/Relevant Enterprises’ Guide to PET [here](https://go.gov.sg/pet) for further details.

  - title: What is considered an acceptable proof of test result for the bride and groom and wedding reception attendees?
    content: |
      Please refer to [MOH’s guidelines](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/pet){:target="_blank"} on acceptable proof of test results.

  - title: Can PET be done at the wedding reception venue?
    content: |  
      Yes, but organisers will need to make their own arrangements, subject to the agreement of venue operators.  

  - title: If PET is required, how long before the solemnization or wedding reception does an individual need to be tested?
    content: |  
      An attendee should get tested a maximum of 24 hours prior to the scheduled end time of the solemnization or wedding reception.

  - title: If I was recently tested and already have a negative PCR test result, can the same COVID-19 Test Result Notice be used to attend a marriage solemnization and wedding reception with PET requirements on the same day?
    content: |  
      Yes, as long as you have a negative result and the event is within the 24-hour validity window. Please refer to MOH’s guidelines at <go.gov.sg/pet>{:target="_blank"} for more information.

  - title: Can the same COVID-19 Test Result Notice be used to attend more than one wedding reception a day?
    content: |  
      Yes, as long as you do not exceed the maximum recommended limit for social gatherings in a day, and the events are within the period of validity of the test result. However, we strongly advise against going to more than one reception in a day. While PET and safe management measures serve to reduce the risk of transmissions, it is not risk-free. Attending multiple large-scale events could put you at higher risk of being infected or being a vector for infection.

  - title: Do vendors (e.g. hotel staff, caterers, photographers) or Solemnizers need to undergo PET?
    content: |  
      No, unless the vendor or Solemnizer is also a guest of the solemnization or wedding (e.g. sits down at a table like other guests).

  - title: With PET, can we relax some of the safe management measures e.g. mask-wearing, intermingling, and allowing attendees to cross zones?
    content: |  
      No, PET does not replace the need for safe management measures. PET serves to reduce the probability of an infected person entering the venue. If an infected person tests antigen negative (i.e. false negative) and attends the wedding, safe management measures will reduce the likelihood of him/ her transmitting the virus to other people at the event and sparking off a large cluster of infections. Both PET and safe management measures serve to further minimise the risk of spread and protect you and your loved ones.

  - title: If most of my guests have been vaccinated, can we do away with PET and SMMs?
    content: |  
      Attendees who have been vaccinated and have a valid cleared status will not have to undergo PET. But PET checks are still needed for those who are not vaccinated. In addition, all attendees, whether vaccinated or not, will still need to adhere to safe management measures to protect unvaccinated individuals should any of the attendees be infected with COVID-19 despite the precautions taken.

  - title: Can the bride and groom choose not to cross zones for marriage solemnizations, and hence not require PET to have a marriage solemnization involving more than 50 attendees?
    content: |  
      No. If the marriage solemnization involves more than 50 attendees, the bride and groom must undergo PET. This is to reduce the risk of large clusters forming at large-scale events and protect unvaccinated individuals should any of the attendees be infected with COVID-19 despite the precautions taken.

  - title: Is PET required for all attendees of wedding receptions with more than 50 attendees, if it adopts staggered timings? Why can’t it be required only for the wedding couple or wedding party who are allowed to attend multiple timeslots?
    content: |  
      Yes, PET is required for all attendees of wedding receptions with more than 50 attendees, even if staggered timing is adopted. While PET and safe management measures serve to reduce the risk of transmissions, it is not risk-free.

  - title: For marriage solemnizations involving more than 50 attendees, can the wedding party also undergo PET and be allowed to cross zones?
    content: |  
      No, the wedding party, even if tested, will not be allowed to cross zones. While PET serves to reduce the probability of an infected person attending the event, there remains a risk of false negative results where an infected person tests antigen negative and attends the wedding. Safe management measures, such as limiting the crossing of zones, reduce the likelihood of such cases transmitting the virus to other people at the event and sparking off a large cluster of infections.

  - title: For wedding receptions involving more than 50 attendees, do we have to test everyone or just the number exceeding 50pax?
    content: |  
      Yes, for wedding receptions involving more than 50 attendees, PET will be required for all attendees (including the wedding couple).

  - title: Will I be compensated if my marriage solemnization/ reception has to be cancelled because the bride/ groom receives a positive / invalid test result?
    content: |  
      No, there will be no compensation from the Government. Holding a marriage event involving more than 50 persons is a personal decision. Couples may wish to work out an arrangement with the venue provider and/or other vendors/service providers to account for the possibility of such a postponement, which would be the same as if the bride and groom were to fall sick or otherwise indisposed.

  - title: I have gone for my first dose of vaccination. Is it true that it may result in a false positive result when I go for pre-event testing? 
    content: |  
      No. Vaccination does not result in a false positive PET ART result. 

accordion-b:
  - title: Can we hold our solemnization at home? What are the safe management measures that we must follow?
    content: |
      Yes, you may hold your solemnization at home.

      As of 8 May 2021, an individual must not permit to enter or remain in his or her place of residence more than 5 visitors on any single day. An exception is made for home solemnizations which are subject to the following limits:

      For solemnization ceremonies held at home, the maximum number of attendees for solemnizations will be, including the wedding couple, (i) 10 persons or (ii) 5 visitors in addition to any residents to the home where the solemnization is held, whichever is higher. This cap excludes the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization (kept to a minimum). For example, if there are 6 persons currently living in your household, the 6 residents and an additional 5 visitors can attend a solemnization in your home. The total of 11 persons counts the wedding couple but excludes the solemnizer and vendors. Or if you live alone, you and 9 other persons, including the wedding couple, can attend a solemnization in your home, excluding the solemnizer and vendors.

      However, if a place of residence has 5 or more visitors attending a home solemnization (as guests or vendors), then the individual must not accept any more visitors that day to his or her place of residence.

      For the safety of all who are attending your solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

      a.	All guests must wear masks for the duration of the solemnization. The bride and groom may choose to wear face shields instead of masks for the duration of the solemnization, and may remove their face shields/masks for key moments such as to exchange vows, rings, to kiss and during march-ins/outs. Other guests must maintain a 2-metre distance from the bride and groom when they are unmasked. The bride, groom, and guests may remove their masks briefly for photo-taking.

      b.	Maintain a safe distance from those from a different household.

      c.	You must also declare to your Licensed Solemnizer the guest and vendor list at least 1 day before the solemnization. This list must be available on-site for verification/ checking.

      We must remain vigilant to protect ourselves and our loved ones. All attendees should check their temperature and ensure they are feeling well before they attend the solemnization. You may wish to encourage your guests, especially if they are more vulnerable, to refrain from attending your solemnization in person. Instead, they can join in the celebrations safely by using technology (e.g. witness the solemnization through a video link).  

      The organiser is liable for ensuring that all attendees observe the necessary safe management measures <sup>8</sup>.

      <sup>8</sup> A person is regarded to be an organiser of a wedding if he/ she (whether or not for reward, and whether jointly or otherwise) procures for, or supplies to, any party to the marriage, the premises and any goods and services for the celebration arrangements in connection with the holding of the wedding.

  - title: Can I still have additional vendors attending my solemnization even if I already have 5 non-resident guests?
    content: |
      Yes, you may. For solemnization ceremonies held at home, the maximum number of attendees for solemnizations will be, including the wedding couple, (i) 10 persons or (ii) 5 visitors in addition to any residents to the home where the solemnization is held, whichever is higher. This cap excludes the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization. However, the number of vendors should be kept to a minimum.

  - title: I am living alone and was intending to have 9 attendees, a solemnizer, and a vendor attending my solemnization at home. Is it still possible to do so with this new cap of 5 visitors a day?
    content: |
      As of 8 May 2021, an individual must not permit to enter or remain in his or her place of residence more than 5 visitors on any single day. An exception is made for home solemnizations which are subject to the following limits:

      For solemnization ceremonies held at home, the maximum number of attendees for solemnizations will be, including the wedding couple, (i) 10 persons or (ii) 5 visitors in addition to any residents to the home where the solemnization is held, whichever is higher. This cap excludes the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization (kept to a minimum). For example, if there are 6 persons currently living in your household, the 6 residents and an additional 5 visitors can attend a solemnization in your home. The total of 11 persons counts the wedding couple but excludes the solemnizer and vendors. Or if you live alone, you and 9 other persons, including the wedding couple, can attend a solemnization in your home, excluding the solemnizer and vendors.

      However, if a place of residence has 5 or more visitors attending a home solemnization (as guests or vendors), then the individual must not accept any more visitors that day to his or her place of residence.

  - title: If I have my solemnization at home in the morning involving 5 or more visitors (attending or working), can I still have another gathering involving another 5 visitors in the evening?
    content: |      
      No, you may not do so as the quota of 5 visitors per/ day has already been used up during the solemnizsation. This also applies for a gathering before the solemnization. Please refer to FAQ 1 for more details.

  - title: Can I have a small wedding reception at home immediately after my solemnization? Can I perform other cultural rites in the home before or after the solemnization?
    content: |  
      Receptions are not allowed in your home. Couples may want to consider having a separate reception at allowed venues where proper safe management measures can be observed more readily. Any other pre- or post-solemnization activities held at home must abide by the prevailing number of visitors allowed for home visits.

  - title: Can I have more than 10 people or 5 visitors for my home solemnization, if my house is sufficiently large to accommodate everybody safely?
    content: |  
      We recognise that your solemnization is an important event for you and your family. However, we are also mindful that due to the intimate nature of solemnizations in the home context, there will likely be high level of chances of interaction. Unlike external venues, there will also be no premises staff to support you in implementing the safe management measures. All these pose greater risks to you, your family, and guests, especially any vulnerable groups who may be present. Hence, the cap for home solemnizations will be, including the wedding couple, (i) 10 persons or (ii) 5 visitors in addition to any residents to the home where the solemnization is held, whichever is higher, regardless of the size of your house.

  - title: How do you determine who is from the hosting household?
    content: |  
      Hosting household will refer to those who are registered to stay in the place of residence that the solemnization will be held at, e.g.  based on the address reflected on the NRIC, occupant list in the lease / tenancy agreement etc.  

  - title: Can we have live instrumental music (without wind instruments) for solemnizations at home?
    content: |  
      Yes, live instrumental music (without the playing of wind instruments) is allowed for solemnizations at home, with the necessary safe management measures in place.

accordion-c:
  - title: What are the safe management measures that we must follow for solemnization in the ROM(M) Building?
    content: |
      Up to 10 persons may attend the solemnization, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, interpreter (if any), and any other vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization (kept to a minimum). These 10 persons may include guests who are not immediate family members.

      For the safety of all who are attending your solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

      1.	All guests must wear masks for the duration of the solemnization. The bride and groom may choose to wear face shields instead of masks for the duration of the solemnization, and may remove their face shields/masks for key moments such as to exchange vows, rings, to  kiss and during march-ins/outs. Other guests must maintain a 2-metre distance from the bride and groom when they are unmasked. Masks may be removed briefly for photo-taking, and must be put on immediately after.

      2.	You will be required to check in and out via SafeEntry before entering the premises.

      3.	You will also need to declare your guests and vendors to ROM during your Verification of Documents and Statutory Declaration appointment.

      We must remain vigilant to protect ourselves and our loved ones. All guests should check their temperature and ensure they are not feeling unwell before they attend the solemnization. You may wish to encourage your guests, especially if they are more vulnerable, to refrain from attending your solemnization in person. Instead, they can join in the celebrations safely by using technology (e.g. witness the solemnization through a video link).  

      The organiser is liable for ensuring that all attendees observe the necessary safe management measures.

For solemnizations involving between 51-250 attendees, PET is required for the wedding couple only. The caps exclude the Licensed Solemnizer, religious and supporting workers, and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization (kept to a minimum).

      For the safety of all who are attending your solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

      1.	For solemnizations with more than 20 attendees, attendees must be split into a designated core “wedding party” comprising up to 20 persons (including the bride and groom, and the 2 witnesses), and groups of up to five people for the remaining guests. At least 1 metre safe distancing must be observed between groups, as well as between the “wedding party” and other groups, at all times, including for photo-taking.

      2.	If the total number of attendees is between 51 to 250 persons, attendees must be split into multiple zones of up to 50 persons in a zone. All attendees, including the “wedding party”, must be assigned to one zone only, and there must be no entering of unassigned zones. An exception is made for the wedding couple, who may enter an unassigned zone briefly e.g. to take photos.

      3.	All guests must wear masks for the duration of the solemnization. The bride and groom may choose to wear face shields instead of masks for the duration of the solemnization, and may remove their face shields for key moments such as to exchange vows, rings, to kiss and, during march-ins/outs, as long as they maintain a safe distance of at least 2 metres from others.

      4.	Masks/ face shields may be removed momentarily for photo-taking, and must  be put on immediately after.

      5.	All attendees must take their temperature, check in and out via SafeEntry before entering the premises, and download and activate the TraceTogether app for the duration of the solemnization.  

      6.	You must also declare to your Solemnizer your guest and vendor list at least 1 day before the solemnization. This list must be available on-site for verification/ checking.

      7.	Live instrumental music (except for the playing of wind instruments) is allowed at solemnizations in indoor venues (subject to respective venue operators’ policies), with the necessary safe management measures in place. All other live performances including singing and dancing remain disallowed.

      We must remain vigilant to protect ourselves and our loved ones. Any guest who is not feeling well must not attend the solemnization. You may wish to encourage your guests, especially if they are more vulnerable, to refrain from attending your solemnization in person. Instead, they can join in the celebrations safely by using technology (e.g. witness the solemnization through a video link).  

      The organiser is liable for ensuring that all attendees observe the necessary safe management measures.

  - title: Can the solemnization be accompanied by a religious service or rite?  
    content: |
      Yes, your solemnization may be accompanied by a religious service or rite. However, for the safety of yourself and your attendees, this should be kept as short as possible. You may contact your Religious Organisation or MCCY’s Crisis Preparedness for Religious Organisations Programme Office at <cpro@mccy.gov.sg>{:target="_blank"} if you have further queries.

  - title: Can I have a small wedding reception at the Place of Worship after my solemnization? Can I perform other cultural rites such as the tea ceremony before or after the solemnization?  
    content: |
      There may not be any reception with food and drinks, or wedding celebrations that are not essential religious rites conducted at places of worship. You may contact your Religious Organisation or MCCY’s Crisis Preparedness for Religious Organisations Programme Office at <cpro@mccy.gov.sg>{:target="_blank"} if you have further queries.

  - title: What are the guidelines for live instrumental music (without wind instruments) at solemnizations held in indoor venues? What is considered an indoor venue?  
    content: |     
      Live instrumental music (without the playing of wind instruments) is allowed at solemnizations held in indoor venues. Performers must maintain a minimum 1m safe distancing from one another and from audience members, and should remain substantially stationary while performing.

      Indoor venues are places which are enclosed and where access to the venue can be controlled, thereby reducing the likelihood of crowding around the venue where the live music is being played at the solemnization. This includes homes as well as function rooms in hotels, restaurants, places of worship and country clubs.

accordion-e:
  - title: Can I have my solemnization at a hotel / F&B restaurant / condominium clubhouse / country club (other private venues) etc?
    content: |

      Yes, provided that the entire premises of the bar or pub is booked and used for the solemnization or the wedding reception, and that for the duration of the solemnization or reception the bar or pub’s normal retail liquor business is discontinued.

  - title: What are the safe management measures that we must follow for solemnizations outside of the home / the ROM(M) Building?
    content: |   
      Up to (a) 50 persons (without PET), or (b) 250 persons (with PET) may attend the solemnization, subject to the safe capacity of the venue. The caps exclude the Licensed Solemnizer, interpreter, and any other vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization (kept to a minimum).

      For the safety of all who are attending your solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

      1.	For solemnizations with more than 20 attendees, attendees must be split into a designated core “wedding party” comprising up to 20 persons (including the bride and groom, and the 2 witnesses), and groups of up to five people for the remaining guests. At least 1 metre safe distancing must be observed between groups, as well as between the “wedding party” and other groups, at all times, including for photo-taking.

      2.	If the total number of attendees is between 51 to 250 persons, attendees must be split into multiple zones of up to 50 persons in a zone. All attendees, including the “wedding party”, must be assigned to one zone only, and there must be no entering of unassigned zones. An exception is made for the wedding couple, who may enter an unassigned zone briefly e.g. to take photos.

      3.	For solemnizations involving between 51-250 attendees, PET is required for the wedding couple. PET must be done (i) before entry to the reception, and (ii) at most 24 hours before the end of the event.

      4.	Masks may be removed briefly for photo-taking, and must be put on immediately after

      5.	Guests will be required to take their temperature, check in and out via SafeEntry before entering the premises, and download and activate the TraceTogether app for the duration of the solemnization. This list must be available on-site for verification/ checking.  

      6.	You must also declare to your Solemnizer your guest and vendor list at least 1 day before the solemnization.

      7.	Premises hosting multiple events or that are accessible by non-wedding patrons and members of the public are to put in place measures to ensure no inter-mixing between events, or between wedding guests and other patrons (e.g. physical barrier, separate rooms).

      8.	Live instrumental music (except for the playing of wind instruments) is allowed at solemnizations in indoor venues (subject to respective venue operators’ policies), with the necessary safe management measures in place. All other live performances including singing and dancing remain disallowed.

      We must remain vigilant to protect ourselves and our loved ones. All guests should check their temperature and ensure they are not feeling unwell before they attend the solemnization. You may wish to encourage your guests, especially if they are more vulnerable, to refrain from attending your solemnization in person. Instead, they can join in the celebrations safely by using technology (e.g. witness the solemnization through a video link).

      The organiser is liable for ensuring that all attendees observe the necessary safe management measures.

  - title: Can I have a pre- / post- solemnization reception or provide food / buffet as part of our ceremony?
    content: |  
      Food and beverages are not allowed to be served as part of the solemnization event. However, couples may hold one reception either on the same day as the solemnization or on a separate day.

  - title: What happens if the solemnization is back to back with the F&B reception i.e. solemnization followed by F&B reception in the same room?
    content: |
      If the solemnization is back-to-back with the F&B reception, the entire event (solemnization and reception) is subject to an overall cap of (a) 50 persons (without PET), or (b) 250 persons (with PET) may attend the solemnization, subject to the safe capacity of the venue. For back-to-back solemnizations and F&B receptions involving between 51-250 persons, PET is required for all attendees (including the wedding couple).  No other receptions would be allowed. Please refer to section 10 of the FAQs for details on the zoning requirements.

  - title: Can I perform other cultural rites such as the tea ceremony before or after the solemnization?
    content: |
      Cultural rites involving food and beverages are not allowed to be conducted as part of the solemnization ceremony. The performance of cultural rites before or after the solemnization must take into account the prevailing national guidelines for that activity.   

      Such cultural rites may take place as part of the wedding reception if they do not involve live performances or other prohibited activities for wedding receptions, subject to the safe management guidelines for receptions. For example, the tea ceremony can be held amongst the “wedding party” of 20 persons as part of the reception, and must take into account the prevailing national guidelines for that activity.

  - title: Can I hold a reception? How many receptions can I hold? What are the guidelines for receptions?
    content: |    
      You can have only one reception, held on the same day as the solemnization or on a separate day. This minimizes the risk to the community. If the reception takes place in the same location right after the solemnization, the entire event (solemnization and reception) is subject to the overall cap of (a) 50 persons (without PET), or (b) 250 persons (with PET), subject to the safe capacity of the venue. For such events involving between 51-250 attendees, PET is required for all attendees (including the wedding couple).

      You may hold your reception in controlled premises opened for operation (outside of the home and the ROM(M) Building) that can accommodate receptions. Please note that any meal exceeding the existing group size for social gatherings, if held back-to-back with the solemnization, shall be deemed a reception. You may check directly with the venue operator on their processes and conditions for the holding of the reception. Venue owners/ operators may determine if and when to allow solemnizations and receptions to be held in their premises, and may set additional conditions for their use, such as setting a lower limit for attendance based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented.

      For such receptions, you may have up to 50 persons, (without PET), or (b) 250 persons (with PET), or the safe capacity of the venue, whichever is lower. For the safety of all who are attending your reception, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

      1.	For receptions with more than 20 attendees, attendees must be split into a designated core “wedding party” comprising up to 20 persons (including the bride and groom, and the 2 witnesses), and groups of up to five people for the remaining guests. At least 1 metre safe distancing must be observed between groups, as well as between the “wedding party” and other groups, at all times, including for photo-taking.

      2.	If the total number of attendees is between 51 to 250 persons, attendees must be split into either multiple zones of up to 50 persons in a zone, or staggered timings with up to 50 persons in each slot with at least 30 minutes between slots for cleaning and disinfection of event space. For a zoning arrangement, all attendees, including the “wedding party”, must be assigned to one zone only, and there must be no entering of unassigned zones. An exception is made for the wedding couple, who may enter an unassigned zone briefly e.g. to take photos. For a staggered timing arrangement, the “wedding party” is allowed to remain in each timeslot as it is the only way for them to host the wedding throughout the day. However, like the zoning arrangement, the “wedding party” must not be intermingling with other groups, and prevailing safe distancing rules i.e. 1m distance between groups, must be observed.

      3.	For receptions involving between 51-250 attendees, PET is required for all attendees (including the wedding couple). PET must be done (i) before entry to the reception, and (ii) at most 24 hours before the end of the event.

      4.	There must be fixed seating for all attendees. Pre-wedding receptions, freestanding activities (e.g photobooths) and interactions such as drinks receptions are not permitted.

      5.	Self-service buffets or staff-served food lines are not allowed. Food and beverages must be served to seated attendees. Sharing dishes/ platters is strongly discouraged.

      6.	Sale and consumption of alcohol is prohibited after 2230hrs.

      7.	Interactions (e.g. face-to-face greetings or conversations) between the “wedding party” and all other guests should be kept to a minimum.

      8.	Live performances (including live instrumental music) or activities involving singing or loud talking/shouting (e.g. loud toasting) are not permitted at receptions. Event emcees and persons making speeches on stage may wear face shields in lieu of face masks when speaking on stage, if they are standing in a fixed position and maintaining at least 1m distance from all other persons, in line with MOH’s guidelines for the use of face masks and shields issued on 1 Jun 2020.

      9.	Guests will be required to take your temperature, check in and out via SafeEntry before entering the premises, and download and activate the TraceTogether app before attending the event.

      10.	Attendees’ arrival and departure timings should be staggered, and queueing in groups should be discouraged.

      We must remain vigilant to protect ourselves and our loved ones. All guests should check their temperature and ensure they are not feeling unwell before they attend the reception. You may wish to encourage your guests, especially if they are more vulnerable, to refrain from attending your solemnization in person. Instead, they can join in the celebrations safely by using technology (e.g. witness the solemnization through a video link).  

      The organiser is liable for ensuring that all attendees observe the necessary safe management measures. Please refer [here](/safemanagement/general/) for the full set of safe management measures. If your venue operator has further questions regarding receptions, they can contact the relevant agency overseeing their operations (e.g. Enterprise Singapore for F&B establishments<sup>10</sup>, Singapore Tourism Board for hotels).

      <sup>10</sup> Please refer to the Safe Management Measures for F&B Establishments at <https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/covid-19/safe-distance#FB>{:target="_blank"}.

  - title: Can I perform other cultural rites such as the tea ceremony during the reception?
    content: |        
      Yes you may, subject to the safe management guidelines for receptions (e.g. no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests). For example, the tea ceremony can be held amongst the “wedding party” of 20 persons as part of the reception, and must take into account the prevailing national guidelines for that activity.

  - title: Can we have our tea ceremony at the external solemnization venue?
    content: |  
      Yes you may, if it is not in a place of worship or in the ROM(M) Building. However,  this will be regarded as separate from the solemnization ceremony, as activities involving food and beverages are not allowed to be conducted as part of the solemnization ceremony. The tea ceremony before or after the solemnization will be subject to the prevailing safe management guidelines for general gatherings (e.g. no more than 5 visitors in a home). Nonetheless, the tea ceremony can be held as part of a wedding reception, amongst the “wedding party” of 20 persons, and must take into account the prevailing national guidelines for that activity.

  - title: Can we do our pre-wedding photo shoots on a separate day from our solemnization?
    content: |  
      You may do your pre-wedding photo shoots on a separate day from your solemnization. Please check directly with the wedding photographer on the Safe Management Measures that must be adhered to.

  - title: Can we hire a photographer to take photos of my wedding dinner/reception, and can the photographer take photos of guests at each table by adhering to the 1 metre distancing?
    content: |  
      Yes, you can hire a photographer to take photos of the wedding reception. A 1-metre distance between the photographer and the subject(s) of photography mustbe maintained at all times.  However, there must be no intermingling between the wedding party and guests (i.e. table-to-table photos should be avoided). Masks may be removed momentarily for photo-taking, and must be put on immediately after.

  - title: Can the bride and groom stand/ sit on the stage and take photos with the wedding party of 20? Can masks be removed momentarily for this?
    content: |  
      Yes, they can mingle and take photos with one another within the wedding party of 20 persons (including the bride and groom). For photo-taking, at least one-metre safe distancing must be observed between the wedding party and other groups, as well as between groups, at all times.   

  - title: Can we play video screenings and/or projections of our wedding photos during the reception?
    content: |  
      Yes, you can. However, there must be no live singing, cheering, loud toasting or shouting during the reception.

  - title: Can weddings that are up to 20 pax be considered a wedding party where the hosts and guests are allowed to interact as a group?
    content: |  
      Yes, if the limit is kept at 20 pax throughout the entire reception.

  - title: If I have a small wedding reception now, can I have another reception should the limits be increased subsequently?
    content: |  
      The conditions for the holding of marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions during the COVID-19 situation will depend on the prevailing circumstances and policies. Based on the current limit of one reception per couple, a second reception is not allowed.

  - title: Must the guests at the solemnization and reception be the same?
    content: |  
      If your solemnization and reception are held separately, they need not be the same  people. However, you are encouraged to keep your number of social contacts to a minimum to reduce the risk of large clusters forming.

      If the reception takes place at the same location right after the solemnization, the entire event (solemnization and reception) is limited to the same guests. Please refer to section 10 of the FAQs for details on the zoning requirements.

  - title: If there are certain guests that attend the reception purely to meet and greet the couple and leave straightaway without sitting in to eat and drink, would they be counted as part of the 50 people (without PET) or 250 people (with PET) attendees limit?
    content: |  
      The total number of attendees for receptions has to be capped at (a) 50 persons (without PET), or (b) 250 persons (with PET), throughout the entire event, or a lower number subject to the size of the premises and safe management requirements. For receptions involving between 51-250 attendees, PET is required for all attendees (including the wedding couple). This includes those who attend the reception for a short duration without eating or drinking

  - title: Are there any duration limits or time restrictions for wedding reception/solemnization?
    content: |  
      Couples may choose to hold their solemnization and reception on a separate day, however, each of these events must be completed in the same calendar day. Within the calendar day of each event, there is no fixed time frame/ duration limit, but it is recommended to keep the sessions as brief as possible.

      For solemnizations in other external  venues,venue operators reserve the right to impose shorter time limits based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented. Please also note that alcohol cannot be served or consumed after 10.30pm.

  - title: Does the set up of the ceremony allow for a stage, reception table etc?
    content: |  
      A stage can be set up as part of the ceremony, but there must be no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests, or between groups of guests. A reception table is allowed, if it is to receive guests when they arrive. However, any interactions should be minimized. E-check-in or other contactless methods of registration should be adopted where possible.

  - title: Is a food line able to be set-up with safe distancing queues and served by the servers at hand?
    content: |  
      Food lines are not permitted at wedding events. At receptions, guests are to be served seated at their tables, instead of queuing at the food lines. This is to minimise unnecessary mingling/ crowding, and to reduce interaction amongst different groups of guests. Organisers can offer individually plated or packaged food, and should avoid shared platters or dishes. For solemnizations, food and beverages are strictly not allowed.   

  - title: Is onsite cooking allowed at my wedding reception?
    content: |  
      On-site cooking is allowed as long as the kitchen staff/personnel remain masked and separated from the guests (similar to a restaurant kitchen). All respective Singapore Food Agency and Food & Beverage sector guidelines must be adhered to.

  - title: Why is live instrumental music (except for the playing of wind instruments) allowed at solemnizations in indoor venues only in Phase 3, and not allowed at outdoor venues?
    content: |  
      Outdoor venues which are not enclosed could easily attract crowds or spread droplets to people who are close by or passing by the area, which increases the public health risks of the event. All live performances in solemnizations will be subject to the prevailing Safe Management Measures for live performances.  

  - title: Why is live instrumental music (except for the playing of wind instruments) allowed at solemnizations at indoor venues in Phase 3, but not allowed at receptions?
    content: |  
      Live performances, including live instrumental music, are not permitted for receptions as attendees will be un-masked when food and drinks are served and there is a tendency for attendees to speak more loudly to be heard over the music from live performances, which increases the risk of transmission.

      If the solemnization in an indoor venue is back-to-back with the wedding reception where food is served, live instrumental music (except the playing of wind instruments) will be allowed only during the solemnization segment (when food and drinks are not served) but not during the reception.

  - title: If my wedding solemnization is held in a place of worship in Phase 3, can I have the same live performance elements as congregational and other worship services in religious organisations (e.g. limited number of singers, wind and other instruments)?
    content: |
      No. Live performance elements (e.g. with a limited number of singers, wind and other instruments) are permitted only for congregational and other worship services as these have been piloted earlier.

accordion-g:
  - title: If we opt for solemnization via video link, can the bride, groom, witnesses and guests be in the same venue? Is there a limit to the number of guests in the same venue?
    content: |  
      The bride, groom, and witnesses can be in the same location if they belong to the same household. If the solemnization is held in the home, then in line with the safe distancing measures, you must not have more than five visitors in your home. Other guests may wish to join in through the video link instead. Such processes through video links are to enable marriage solemnizations to take place in a safe manner.

accordion-h:
  - title: For a zoning arrangement, can I have as many zones as I want?
    content: |  
      If the venue permits, you may have more than two zones subject to the overall attendance of the entire event being capped at the maximum allowable limit, the number of people in each zone not exceeding 50 pax, and zoning rules being adhered to (including a 3-metre gap and a continuous physical barrier or a solid partition of 1.8 metre or taller between zones). These caps include the couple and the wedding party, but excludes solemnizer (for the solemnisation), vendors engaged to provide authorised services and venue staff (to be kept to a minimum). We understand venues may have different configurations and encourage couples to work out an optimal arrangement with the venue operator. Couples may choose to configure the zones in a way that allows the wedding couple/party to access ‘central’ areas, such as the aisle and the stage. All attendees, including the “wedding party”),must be assigned to only one zone. Regardless of the number of zones, entering an unassigned zone is not allowed, except for the wedding couple, who may do so briefly e.g. to take photos. Arrangements must also be made to ensure attendees from different zones do not meet each other at entrances or exits. For instance, organisers could deploy ushers at the entrances and exits of each zone. Within each zone, there must be no intermingling and mixing between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests.

  - title: For a staggered timing arrangement, can I have as many time slots as I want?
    content: |        
      If the venue permits, you may have more than two time slots subject to the overall attendance of the entire event being capped at the maximum allowable limit, the number of people in each time slot not exceeding 50 pax, and staggered timing rules being adhered to (including a 30-minute gap between time slots). These caps include the couple and the wedding party, but excludes vendors engaged to provide authorised services and venue staff (to be kept to a minimum). The duration of the entire event must be kept within the same calendar day.

      Guests must be assigned to one time slot only, and can only be present in their assigned timeslot. Only the “wedding party” (up to 20 pax) may remain between time slots, whereas all other guests must only belong to one timeslot. There must be a minimum of 30 minutes between time slots, where cleaning and disinfection at the event space (e.g. common/shared surfaces such as seats) and other common areas (e.g. toilets) must be conducted. Within each timeslot, there must be no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests i.e. a 1 metre distance between these groups must be observed.

      Venue operators may impose shorter time limits as they deem fit, based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented.

  - title: Why is the wedding party allowed to remain for each time slot in a staggered timing arrangement, but not allowed to cross zones in a zoning arrangement?
    content: |   
      Both arrangements adhere to the safety principle that there should be no more than 50 persons at one place (zone) at one time (time slot). Within each zone or timeslot, there must similarly be no intermingling and mixing between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests. In a zoning arrangement, only the wedding couple is allowed to cross zones briefly (e.g. to take photos).

      In a staggered timing arrangement, the wedding party is allowed to remain in each timeslot as it is the only way for them to host the wedding throughout the entire event. However, like the physical zoning arrangement, the wedding party must not be intermingling with other groups, and prevailing safe distancing rules i.e. 1m distance between groups, must be observed. Additional safety measures must be taken such as requiring a minimum of 30 minutes between time slots, where cleaning and disinfection at the event space (e.g. common/shared surfaces such as seats) and other common areas (e.g. toilets) must be conducted.

  - title: Is the wedding party included in the 50-per-zone cap
    content: |   
      Yes. There must be no more than 50 people in each zone, and each attendee (including the wedding party) must be assigned to only one zone. Couples may choose to configure the zones in a way that allows the wedding couple/party to access ‘central areas’, such as the aisle and the stage. Regardless of the number and configuration of zones,  entering unassigned zones is not allowed, except for the wedding couple who may do so briefly e.g. to take photos.

  - title: Can I split my wedding party across zones?
    content: |  
      Yes. However, once the wedding party is split across zones, they can no longer enter other unassigned zones or interact with other members of the wedding party that are in separate zones during the event. There is an exception for the wedding couple, who may cross zones briefly e.g. to take photos, but at least 1m safe distancing must be observed between the couple and other groups, as well as between groups, at all times, including for photo-taking.

  - title: Can the wedding party cross zones?
    content: |  
      No, like any attendee, each member of the wedding party must be assigned to one zone only and not enter unassigned zones. There is an exception for the wedding couple, who may cross zones briefly e.g. to take photos, but at least 1m safe distancing must be observed between the couple and other groups, as well as between groups, at all times, including for photo-taking. This is to reduce the overall risk exposure for members of the wedding party as well as guests in each zone.  

  - title: Can the zone with the wedding party have more than 50 pax?
    content: |  
      No, the number of people in each zone is capped at 50 pax. This includes the wedding party.

  - title: Can I split my reception into lunch and dinner at the same venue on the same day?
    content: |  
      Yes. You may split your reception into lunch and dinner if it is at the same venue and entire event is completed within a day. This is subject to the overall attendance of the entire event being capped at the maximum allowable limit, the number of people in each time slot not exceeding 50 pax, and staggered timing rules being adhered to (including a 30-minute gap between time slots). These caps include the couple and the wedding party, but excludes vendors engaged to provide authorised services and venue staff (to be kept to a minimum). The duration of the entire event must be kept within the same calendar day.

      Guests can only arrive and leave in their scheduled timeslot. Only the wedding party (up to 20 pax) may remain between time slots, whereas all other guests must only belong to one timeslot. There must be a minimum of 30 minutes between time slots, where cleaning and disinfection at the event space (e.g. common/shared surfaces such as seats) and other common areas (e.g. toilets) must be conducted. Within each timeslot, there must be no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests i.e. a 1 metre distance between these groups must be observed.

      Venue operators may impose shorter time limits as they deem fit, based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented.

  - title: Can I split my wedding party across time slots?
    content: |  
      Yes. In a staggered timing arrangement, the wedding party is allowed to remain in each timeslot as it is the only way for them to host the reception throughout the day. If you prefer, you may split your wedding party across time slots.

  - title: For a staggered timing arrangement, can I hold my wedding reception at different venues?
    content: |  
      Wedding receptions across different premises are not allowed, although the event may take place in multiple rooms  within the same premises managed by the same operator. The couple should provide the full names of the attendees across the different venues to the venue operators. The entire reception must be completed within the same calendar day.

  - title: For a staggered timing arrangement, can I have my wedding reception across different days?
    content: |        
      No. Couples can only hold one reception, which limits the total risk exposure. Even in a staggered timing arrangement, the entire reception must be completed within the same day.

  - title: My wedding venue is large enough to accommodate more than 50 pax with appropriate safe distancing between groups of 5, is zoning still necessary?
    content: |    
      Yes. Regardless of venue, the number of people in each zone is capped at 50 pax. All attendees are to be assigned one zone only and entering an unassigned zone is not allowed. This is to minimise participants’ total risk exposure and the risk of bunching at common areas including entrances and exits. Organisers are to ensure at least 3m distance between zones with the use of physical barriers e.g. queue poles, or use a solid partition of 1.8 metres or taller between zones. Organisers must also undertake measures to avoid guests crossing between zones. Arrangements must also be made to ensure attendees from different zones do not meet each other at entrances or exits. For instance, organisers could deploy ushers at the entrances and exits of each zone.

  - title: What are the requirements/guidelines for cleaning and disinfection during the intervals between time slots?
    content: |   
      Before the start of each time slot and where applicable, the venue owner/ operator or organisers must clean and disinfect function spaces, common facilities (e.g. toilets), tables and chairs before and after use, including high-touch areas such as handrails, door handles, lift buttons, etc. It is a good practice for the venue owner/ operator or organisers to provide disinfecting agents like hand sanitisers, disinfectant sprays, wipes, etc. for attendees and staff at common or high-touch areas.

  - title: Are common areas such as toilets subject to zonal restrictions?
    content: |   
      Organisers are encouraged to designate specific common areas and facilities to specific zones. If this is not possible, organisers should identify hotspots e.g. entry/ exit points, washrooms, corridors, etc. for potential bunching and implement a control mechanism to prevent/ disperse crowds e.g. staggered entrances and exits. This could include the deployment of Safety Ambassadors to remind attendees against clustering and loitering in common areas. Where possible, common surfaces should be wiped down after each use.

  - title: If the wedding party is only part of one zone, does it mean they cannot take photos with guests from the other zone?
    content: |   
      Only the wedding couple is allowed to cross zones briefly to take photos. The rest of the wedding party are not allowed to cross zones, like all other attendees. For photo-taking within zones, at least 1m safe distancing must be observed between groups, as well as between the “wedding party” and other groups, at all times, including for photo-taking.

  - title: Do the vendor staff and photographer have to be assigned to zones as well? Can they cross zones?
    content: |   
      Vendor staff need not be confined to zones, as they come into contact with participants only transiently and are always masked. The photographer may follow the wedding couple across zones for photo taking.
