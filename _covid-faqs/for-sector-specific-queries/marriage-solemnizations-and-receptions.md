    - title: If my wedding reception is held right after my solemnisation, how many attendees can I have?
      content: |
        If the solemnization is back-to-back with the F&B reception, the entire event (solemnization and reception) is subject to an overall cap of 100 persons (with PET for all), limited to the same guests, and subject to the safe capacity of the venue. 

    - title: What guidelines are my reception subjected to?
      content: |
        You can have **<u>only one</u>** reception. If the reception takes place in the same location right after the solemnization, the entire event (solemnization and reception) is subject to the overall cap of 100 persons (with PET), subject to the safe capacity of the venue.

        You may hold your reception in any premises opened for operation (outside of the home and the ROM(M) Building) that can accommodate receptions. **Please note that any meal exceeding the existing group size for social gatherings, if held back-to-back with the solemnization, shall be deemed a reception.** You may check directly with the venue operator on their processes and conditions for the holding of the reception. Venue owners/ operators may determine if and when to allow solemnizations and receptions to be held in their premises, and may set additional conditions for their use, such as setting a lower limit for attendance based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented. 

        For the safety of all who are attending your reception, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

        a.	For receptions with more than 20 attendees, attendees must be split into a designated core “wedding party” comprising up to 20 persons (including the bride and groom, and the 2 witnesses), and groups of up to 5 people for the remaining guests. At least 1 metre safe distancing must be observed between groups, as well as between the “wedding party” and other groups, at all times, including for photo-taking.

        b.	If the total number of attendees is between 50 to 100 persons, attendees must be split into either multiple zones of up to 50 persons in a zone, or staggered timings with up to 50 persons in each slot with at least 30 minutes between slots for cleaning and disinfection of event space. For a zoning arrangement, all attendees, including the “wedding party”, must be assigned to one zone only, and there must be no entering of unassigned zones. An exception is made for the wedding couple, who may enter an unassigned zone briefly e.g. to take photos. For a staggered timing arrangement, the “wedding party” is allowed to remain in each timeslot as it is the only way for them to host the wedding throughout the day. However, like the zoning arrangement, the “wedding party” must not be intermingling with other groups, and prevailing safe distancing rules i.e. 1m distance between groups, must be observed.

        c.	PET is required for all attendees (including the wedding couple). PET must be done (i) before entry to the reception, and (ii) at most 24 hours before the end of the event. 

        d.	There must be fixed seating for all attendees. Pre-wedding receptions, freestanding activities (e.g. photobooths) and interactions such as drinks receptions are not permitted.

        e.	Self-service buffets or staff-served food lines are not allowed. Food and beverages must be served to seated attendees. Sharing dishes/ platters is strongly discouraged. 

        f.	Sale and consumption of alcohol is prohibited after 2230hrs.

        g.	Interactions (e.g. face-to-face greetings or conversations) between the “wedding party” and all other guests should be kept to a minimum. 

        h.	Live performances (including live instrumental music) or activities involving singing or loud/ talking shouting (e.g. loud toasting) are not permitted at receptions. Event emcees and persons making speeches on stage must wear face masks.

        i.	Guests will be required to take your temperature, check in and out via SafeEntry before entering the premises, and download and activate the TraceTogether app before attending the event.

        j.	Attendees’ arrival and departure timings should be staggered, and queueing in groups should be discouraged.

    - title: Can the bride and groom stand/ sit on the stage and take photos with the wedding party of 20? Can masks be removed momentarily for this?
      content: |
        Yes, they can mingle and take photos with one another within the wedding party of 20 persons (including the bride and groom). For photo-taking, at least one-metre safe distancing must be observed between the wedding party and other groups, as well as between groups, at all times.  Masks should remain on at all times except for the bride and groom who may wear a face shield.

    - title: Can we play video screenings and/or projections of our wedding photos during the reception?
      content: |
        Yes, you can. However, there must be no live singing, cheering, loud toasting or shouting during the reception.

    - title: If there are certain guests that attend the reception purely to meet and greet the couple and leave straightaway without sitting in to eat and drink, would they be counted as part of the 100 people (with PET) attendees limit?
      content: |
        The total number of attendees for receptions has to be capped at 100 persons (with PET) throughout the entire event, or a lower number subject to the size of the premises and safe management requirements. This includes those who attend the reception for a short duration without eating or drinking.

    - title: What are the latest guidelines given the heightened situation?
      content: |
        Following the measures introduced on 8 May 2021, we need to tighten more measures to decisively arrest the increasing number of cases in the community. From 16 May to 13 Jun 2021, F&B establishments will not be allowed to offer dine-in services. In line with this measure, wedding receptions will not be allowed.

        Marriage solemnizations may continue, and will be subject to the following limits:

        |Activity|Max No. of Attendees, including Bride and Groom (Without Pre-Event Testing)|Max No. of Attendees, including Bride and Groom (With Pre-Event Testing)|
        |Solemnizations|1-50|51-100 Pre-Event Testing required for <ins>all unvaccinated attendees</ins>|

        With the tightened measures, PET will be required for all unvaccinated attendees for solemnizations involving 51 to 100 attendees. (Previously, PET was required for the marriage couple only for solemnizations involving more than 51 to 250 attendees.) Attendees who have successfully completed the COVID-19 vaccination in Singapore are exempted from PET (i.e. 14 days have passed since the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination).

        For marriage solemnizations held in a place of residence, the maximum number of attendees for the home solemnization will continue to be capped at 10 persons. This includes the marriage couple but does not count the Solemnizer and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization.

        For solemnizations at the ROM/M Building, the maximum number of attendees will continue to be capped at 10 persons.
        All marriage solemnisations will continue to be subject to the prevailing safe management measures, such as safe distancing rules.

    - title: Why are measures tightened so quickly? 
      content: |
        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation. The number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and unlinked community cases has continued to increase. This is concerning as the situation could quickly escalate if these cases are not contained swiftly and decisively. 

    - title: Why must wedding receptions be cancelled altogether? Why are the requirements for weddings stricter than other types of events (e.g. MICE)?
      content: |
        Dine-in F&B establishments are a higher-risk setting as customers often dine for prolonged periods in close proximity with one another with their masks-off. To reduce the risk of community transmission, there will be cessation of dine-in food & beverage. In line with this measure, wedding receptions are not allowed.  
        
        We seek the cooperation of everyone to adhere with the prevailing safe management measures to keep you and your loved ones safe.

    - title: My marriage solemnisation is from 16 May to 13 Jun 2021 and I have invited 51 to 100 guests. As PET is now required for all attendees, where and how can we and our guests get tested?
      content: |
        There are approximately 200 ART providers islandwide, including GP clinics and private hospitals. Some even have 24-hour capacity. Please click [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/list-of-covid-19-swab-providers){:target="_blank"} for a list of MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers.

    - title: My wedding is after 13 Jun 2021 (e.g. 19 Jun 2021), can I proceed to plan for my wedding reception and how many guests can I invite?
      content: |
        These requirements are based on the current situation. The Government will monitor the situation closely and review the requirements accordingly. Couples and wedding organisers can take reference from the prevailing requirements and should be prepared that the requirements may change at any point of time, given the dynamic COVID-19 situation.

    - title: Given the short notice, are vendors (e.g. hotels, restaurants) required to allow couples to postpone their wedding receptions without penalties?
      content: |
        This would be subject to the contractual agreements between vendors and the wedding couples or mutually acceptable arrangements. Given the dynamic COVID-19 situation, we hope all parties, including vendors and couples, can exercise flexibility and mutual understanding in adjusting their plans.

    - title: With the further tightening of measures, how many persons can I have at my solemnization ceremony?
      content: |
        Places of residence

        As of 16 May 2021, an individual must not permit to enter or remain in his or her place of residence more than 2 visitors on any single day. An exception is made for home solemnizations which are subject to the following limits:

        For marriage solemnizations held in a place of residence, the maximum number of attendees for the home solemnization must not exceed, including the couple, 10 persons, not counting the Solemnizer and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization.    Vendors should be kept to the minimum required.

        The household must not accept any more visitors that day to his or her place of residence. 


        ROM/M Building 

        For solemnizations held at ROMM building, up to 10 persons may attend the solemnization, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, interpreter (if any), and any other vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization (kept to a minimum). 


        External venues

        For solemnizations held in external solemnization venues, such as places of worship or hotels, the maximum number of attendees will be (a) a total of 50 persons or a lower number (without Pre-Event Testing (PET)), or (b) 100 persons (with PET), or the safe capacity of the venue, whichever is lower. For solemnizations involving between 51-100 attendees, PET is required for all unvaccinated attendees. This cap excludes the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization (kept to a minimum). Please check with the venue owner / operator on the number of attendees allowed and any other conditions to be met before making arrangements. 

    - title: What are the safe management measures that we must follow?
      content: |
        Please refer to sector-specific requirements for marriage solemnizations [here](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector/){:target="_blank"}.

    - title: Are vendors (e.g. photographers, videographers, make-up artists, bridal studio) part of the guest limit? 
      content: |
        Vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization are excluded from the attendance limit for your solemnization, but should be kept to a minimum. 

    - title: Can the bride and groom remove face masks for the solemnization ceremony? Can the bride and groom use face shields in place of face masks? Can the rest of the attendees be unmasked for photo-taking? 
      content: |
        The bride and groom must use face masks or face shields throughout the solemnization process. All other attendees must have their masks on throughout the solemnization process <sup>1</sup>.

        Masks / face shields should be retained even for photo-taking.

        <sup>1</sup> Children aged twelve years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time, may wear a face shield as indicated in MOH’s Advisory of 1 Jun 2020 (“Guidance for Use of Masks and Face Shields”)

    - title: How long can our solemnization ceremony last?
      content: |
        For the safety of the bride, groom, and guests, the solemnization should be kept as brief as possible.

    data:
    - title: If we opt for solemnization via video link, can the bride, groom, witnesses and guests be in the same venue? Is there a limit to the number of guests in the same venue?
      content: |
        The bride, groom, and witnesses can be in the same location if they belong to the same household. If the solemnization is held in the home, then in line with the attendance limit for solemnizations at places of residence, the maximum number of attendees for the home solemnization must not exceed, including the couple, 10 persons, not counting the Solemnizer and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization. Other guests may wish to join in through the video link instead. Such processes through video links are to enable marriage solemnizations to take place in a safe manner.

    letter: e
    data:
    - title: What is Pre-Event Testing (“PET”)?
      content: |
        A “Pre-Event Test” (PET) refers to a COVID-19 test taken by an attendee or patron who wishes to enter a premise where certain events, businesses, or activities are being held. This attendee or patron must obtain a negative COVID-19 test result within a specified period of time, before being allowed to enter the venue.

    - title: When is PET required for marriage solemnizations?
      content: |
        For marriage solemnizations involving 51 to 100 attendees, PET will be required for the all unvaccinated attendees. Marriage solemnizations involving 50 or fewer attendees do not require PET. 

        The PET must be done: (i) Before entry to the solemnization; and (ii) At most 24 hours before the end of the event. 

        Organisers of solemnizations should ensure that PET requirements are met for such events involving more than 50 attendees. PET for all events, including solemnizations, will not be funded by the government; organisers or individuals are responsible for paying for their own tests. 

        Please refer to MOH’s guidelines at go.gov.sg/pet for more information on PET. 

        All marriage solemnizations will continue to be subject to the prevailing safe management measures, such safe distancing rules.

    - title: Where can I find more information about PET? E.g. exemptions, acceptable proof of test results, validity of results, operating PET at the venue.
      content: |
        Please refer to MOH’s guidelines at [go.gov.sg/pet](https://go.gov.sg/pet){:target="_blank"} for more information on PET. 

    - title: Can the same COVID-19 Test Result Notice be used to attend more than one solemnization a day?
      content: |
        Yes, as long as you do not exceed the maximum recommended limit for social gatherings in a day, and the events are within the period of validity of the test result. However, we strongly advise against going to more than one solemnization in a day. While PET and safe management measures serve to reduce the risk of transmissions, it is not risk-free. Attending multiple large-scale events could put you at higher risk of being infected or being a vector for infection.

    - title: Do vendors (e.g. photographers) or Solemnizers need to undergo PET?
      content: |
        No, unless the vendor or Solemnizer is also a guest of the solemnization. 

    - title: Will I be compensated if my marriage solemnization has to be cancelled because the bride/ groom receives a positive / invalid test result?
      content: |
        No, there will be no compensation from the Government. Couples may wish to work out an arrangement with the venue provider and/or other vendors/service providers to account for the possibility of such a postponement, which would be the same as if the bride and groom were to fall sick or otherwise indisposed.

    - title: I have gone for my first dose of vaccination. Is it true that it may result in a false positive result when I go for pre-event testing?
      content: |
        No. Vaccination does not result in a false positive PET ART result.

    - title: For a zoning arrangement, can I have as many zones as I want?
      content: |
        If the venue permits, you may have more than two zones subject to the overall attendance of the entire event being capped at the maximum allowable limit, the number of people in each zone not exceeding 50 pax, and zoning rules being adhered to (including a 3-metre gap and a continuous physical barrier or a solid partition of 1.8 metre or taller between zones). These caps include the couple and the “solemnization party”, but excludes Solemnizer (for the solemnization), vendors engaged to provide authorised services and venue staff (to be kept to a minimum). We understand venues may have different configurations and encourage couples to work out an optimal arrangement with the venue operator. Couples may choose to configure the zones in a way that allows the couple/ “solemnization party” to access ‘central’ areas, such as the aisle and the stage. All attendees, including the “solemnization party”, must be assigned to only one zone. Regardless of the number of zones, entering an unassigned zone is not allowed, except for the couple, who may do so briefly e.g. to take photos. Arrangements must also be made to ensure attendees from different zones do not meet each other at entrances or exits. For instance, organisers could deploy ushers at the entrances and exits of each zone. Within each zone, there must be no intermingling and mixing between the “solemnization party” and other groups of guests or between groups of guests.

    - title: Is the solemnization party included in the 50-per-zone cap?
      content: |
        Yes. There must be no more than 50 people in each zone, and each attendee (including the solemnization party) must be assigned to only one zone. Couples may choose to configure the zones in a way that allows the couple/ “solemnization party” to access ‘central areas’, such as the aisle and the stage. Regardless of the number and configuration of zones, entering unassigned zones, except for the couple who may do so briefly e.g. to take photos.

    - title: Can I split my “solemnization party” across zones?
      content: |
        Yes. However, once the solemnization party is split across zones, they can no longer enter other unassigned zones or interact with other members of the “solemnization party” that are in separate zones during the event. There is an exception for the couple, who may cross zones briefly e.g. to take photos, but at least 1m safe distancing must be observed between the couple and other groups, as well as between groups, at all times, including for photo-taking.

    - title: Can the “solemnization party” cross zones? 
      content: |
        No, like any attendee, each member of the “solemnization party” must be assigned to one zone only and not enter unassigned zones. There is an exception for the couple, who may cross zones briefly e.g. to take photos, but at least 1m safe distancing must be observed between the couple and other groups, as well as between groups, at all times, including for photo-taking. This is to reduce the overall risk exposure for members of the solemnization party as well as guests in each zone.  

    - title: Can the zone with the “solemnization party” have more than 50 pax?
      content: |
        No, the number of people in each zone is capped at 50 pax. This includes the “solemnization party”.

    - title: My venue is large enough to accommodate more than 50 pax with appropriate safe distancing between groups of 2 is zoning still necessary? 
      content: |
        Yes. Regardless of venue, the number of people in each zone is capped at 50 pax. All attendees are to be assigned one zone only and entering an unassigned zone is not allowed. This is to minimise participants’ total risk exposure and the risk of bunching at common areas including entrances and exits. Organisers are to ensure at least 3m distance between zones with the use of physical barriers e.g. queue poles, or use a solid partition of 1.8 metres or taller between zones. Organisers must also undertake measures to avoid guests crossing between zones. Arrangements must also be made to ensure attendees from different zones do not meet each other at entrances or exits. For instance, organisers could deploy ushers at the entrances and exits of each zone.

    - title: Are common areas such as toilets subject to zonal restrictions?
      content: |
        Organisers are encouraged to designate specific common areas and facilities to specific zones. If this is not possible, organisers should identify hotspots e.g. entry/ exit points, washrooms, corridors, etc. for potential bunching and implement a control mechanism to prevent/ disperse crowds e.g. staggered entrances and exits. This could include the deployment of Safety Ambassadors to remind attendees against clustering and loitering in common areas. Where possible, common surfaces should be wiped down after each use.

    - title: If the “solemnization party” is only part of one zone, does it mean they cannot take photos with guests from the other zone?
      content: |
        Only the couple is allowed to cross zones briefly to take photos. The rest of the “solemnization party” are not allowed to cross zones, like all other attendees. For photo-taking within zones, at least 1m safe distancing must be observed between groups, as well as between the “solemnization party” and other groups, at all times, including for photo-taking. 

    - title: Do the vendor staff and photographer have to be assigned to zones as well? Can they cross zones?
      content: |
        Vendor staff need not be confined to zones, as they come into contact with participants only transiently and are always masked. The photographer may follow the couple across zones for photo-taking.
