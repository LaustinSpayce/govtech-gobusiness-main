  - title: When can face-to-face lessons at private residences, tuition centres and enrichment centres resume?
    content: |
      Face-to-face tuition and enrichment classes have been allowed to resume from 19 June 2020 in accordance to safe management measures.

  - title: Are all types of tuition and enrichment classes allowed to resume?
    content: |
      Most face-to-face tuition and enrichment classes were allowed to resume from Phase Two, which started on 19 June 2020. In line with the rest of the economy, they are subject to safe management measures. For more information, please refer [here](/safemanagement/sector/){:target="_blank"}.

      Classes which involve activities with potentially higher risk of virus transmission through droplet spread (such as singing, voice projection, playing of wind or brass instruments or other instruments that require intentional expulsion of air) have been allowed to resume from 3 August 2020. They will be subject to additional safe management measures as seen [here](https://www.nac.gov.sg/whatwedo/support/sustaining-the-arts-during-covid-19/Arts-and-Culture-Sector-Advisories.html){:target="_blank"}, in view of the higher risks involved.  

  - title: What are the safe management measures that tuition and enrichment centres should be implementing?
    content: |
      To reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19, tuition and enrichment centres are required to abide by the nationwide safe management measures for workplaces issued on 9 May 2020. These include health checks and declarations for all employees and students, the use of SafeEntry to support contact tracing, and regular cleaning of common facilities and high-touch areas. More details are available at the [MOE website](http://www.moe.gov.sg/faqs-covid-19-infection){:target="_blank"} and [GoBusiness website](/safemanagement/general/){:target="_blank"}.    

  - title: Some tuition and enrichment classes involve high movement activities (e.g. sports, dance), or activities which carry a higher risk of virus transmission through droplet spread (e.g. singing, wind/brass instruments). What additional safe management measures should be implemented?
    content: |
      The following additional safe management measures apply:

      **Sports and Dance Classes**

      a. Masks may only be removed when performing strenuous activities, although it is still recommended as good practice that masks be worn even under such circumstances.

      b. Participants should maintain at least 2m safe distancing from others, and try to minimise physical contact as much as possible

      c. There should be a minimum of 3m spacing between each group, if more than one group is using the same venue.

      **Singing, Voice Training, Speech and Drama, Wind/Brass Instrument Classes**

      a. Group sizes are limited to five participants (excluding one instructor), except for singing classes which are limited to one participant (excluding one instructor). No more than one group is permitted in the same room.

      b. Masks must continue to be worn as a default, except when unmasking is necessary for the activity. If possible, face shields should be worn even when unmasked.

      c. Participants should maintain at least 2m safe distancing from others and refrain from positioning themselves directly opposite each other. For singing classes, participants should sing away from each other. If they cannot do so, they should maintain more than 2m safe distancing from each other.

      d. For wind/brass instrument classes,

      i. Instructors should continue to wear masks when singing or humming a passage of music to demonstrate how it should sound when played on the instrument.
      ii. Participants should play on wind instruments which are fully intact, and refrain from training practices involving only parts of the instrument (e.g. mouthpiece buzzing, playing with just the lead pipe) to prevent droplet transmission.
      iii. Sharing of music instruments or parts thereof (e.g. mouthpieces, reeds) is not allowed.
      iv. Liquids from instruments (i.e. condensation and saliva) must be collected and disposed of hygienically.

      For detailed guidance, please also refer to the advisories issued by [Sport Singapore](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/newsroom/media-releases/2020/advisory-for-resumption-of-sport-and-physical-exercise-and-activity-for-phase-two-safe-transition){:target="_blank"} and the [National Arts Council](https://www.nac.gov.sg/whatwedo/support/sustaining-the-arts-during-covid-19/Arts-and-Culture-Sector-Advisories.html){:target="_blank"}.

  - title: Will private tutors who are operating out of private residences be allowed to resume face-to-face lessons?
    content: |
      Yes, private tutors who are not based in centres have been allowed to resume lessons from Phase Two i.e.  19 June 2020. Home-based tuition/enrichment is subject to prevailing safe management measures for home-based services, including the cap of eight unique visitors allowed in the home in a single day. Such tutors must also use SafeEntry for visitors to support contact tracing; if the tutor is awaiting the set-up of a SafeEntry account, s/he should maintain a manual log of visitors in the interim.

      Parents and tutors should also adhere to prevailing safe distancing measures, i.e. they should ensure that students and tutors maintain safe distancing of at least one metre at all times, with strictly no physical interaction between individuals. If it is not possible to apply one metre safe distancing between students (e.g. in residences), tutors must limit classes to no more than eight persons, including the tutor, with suitable spacing between individuals where possible.

      Private tutors operating out of residences are also advised to put in place appropriate precautionary measures, and work with parents to ensure that they are comfortable with the measures taken. These should include:

      a.	Wearing of masks by all staff and students
      b.	Temperature screening and health declarations (tutors should turn away or not conduct tuition for persons who are unwell or have been issued with Approved Absence/Leave of Absence by their respective schools or Stay Home Notice/Home Quarantine Order by the authorities)
      c.	Clear record-keeping of staff/students to facilitate contact-tracing (Note: Where the tutor has to visit multiple places of residence, the tutor is expected to maintain a personal log of his/her activities, to facilitate contact tracing if necessary.)
      d.	Disinfection of surfaces between classes, if venue is hosted by tutor and shared by multiple students
