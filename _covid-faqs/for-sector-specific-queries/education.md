  - title: Are all face-to-face lessons at private residences, tuition centres and enrichment centres allowed to resume? 
    content: |
      While most face-to-face tuition and enrichment classes are allowed to resume subject to safe management measures, they are encouraged to consider <ins>online lessons as the default arrangement in Phase Two (Heightened Alert) during this period of heightened risk</ins>, to reduce physical contact between individuals.

      If in-person tuition lessons are to be held at private residences, the tutor and student(s) should be masked at all times.

      Classes which involve activities with potentially higher risk of virus transmission through droplet spread (such as singing, playing of wind or brass instruments or other instruments that require intentional expulsion of air) <ins>must be suspended</ins> from 16 May to 13 Jun 2021 (dates inclusive). Voice training and speech and drama classes may continue, subject to additional safe management measures (see below). 

  - title: What are the safe management measures that tuition and enrichment centres should be implementing?
    content: |
      To reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19, tuition and enrichment centres are required to abide by the nationwide safe management measures for workplaces issued on 9 May 2020. These include health checks, the use of SafeEntry to support contact tracing for all employees, students and other visitors, wearing of masks at all times, and regular cleaning of common facilities and high-touch areas. More details are available at the [GoBusiness website](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/general/){:target="_blank"}. 

      Tuition and enrichment centres must ensure that work-from-home is the default arrangement for employees who are able to do so.

      Hence, tuition and enrichment centres are encouraged to consider telecommuting and online lessons as the default arrangement. In the event that face-to-face classes continue, they are expected to observe all the following measures in classrooms and other areas accessed by students:

      a. **Safe distancing**. Safe distancing measures for tuition and enrichment are:
        
        i.	Students: Centres must ensure safe distancing between students by putting up appropriate floor demarcations and/or physical barriers, e.g. using safety tape. There must also be strict separation between students in different classrooms at all times, with no intermingling.
          <br>I.	As a default, centres must ensure that all students maintain safe distancing of at least 1m at all times, with strictly no physical interaction between students. 
          <br>II.	If it is not possible to apply 1m safe distancing between students and some interaction is unavoidable, centres may instead organise students into groups of no more than two students, with strictly no physical interaction or intermingling between different groups. Centres must strictly maintain a minimum of 1m spacing between pairs, although MOE advises 2m spacing between pairs as a best practice.

        ii.	Tutors/instructors: They can move between pairs. However, contact should be transient, and they should remain at the front of the class as much as is practicable.

        iii.	Capacity: No single room within a centre should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors, even as the above measures are adopted.

        iv.	Centres are also reminded that per MOM’s guidelines for workplaces, there should be no cross-deployment across worksites. More information on prevailing workplace SMMs can be found on the [MOM website](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}.

      b. **Health declarations**. Private tuition and enrichment centres should not permit students who are placed on Leave of Absence (LOA) or Approved Absence (AA) by their schools, or students who are on a Stay Home Notice (SHN), or Home Quarantine Order (HQO) to attend lessons. In alignment with practices in MOE schools, we also advise centres to watch out for students with fever or respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, breathlessness, runny nose, loss of sense of smell, cough, or sore throat. Students with symptoms of the above or are otherwise unwell should be sent home immediately, and not allowed to attend lessons. As a best practice, they should also check if a family member living in the same household is unwell. If so, the child should not attend lessons in person.

      c. **Disinfection of surfaces**. All surfaces in classrooms must be thoroughly disinfected between classes. Sharing of all equipment (e.g. props, microphones) should be avoided as far as possible. If this cannot be done, the equipment should be thoroughly cleaned and/or disinfected before being handled or used by others. Please note that sharing of wind/brass instruments or parts thereof (e.g. mouthpieces, reeds) is not allowed  (please refer to questions below for details; note that all in-person singing, and wind/brass instrument classes are suspended during Phase Two (Heightened Alert)).

      d. **Masks must be worn as a default at all times**, except for persons allowed to use face shields instead of masks (e.g. persons with health conditions resulting in breathing/medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period). Children aged between 2 and 6 years of age should continue to wear masks/face shields when attending tuition and enrichment classes, as they are still in a group setting and may interact with others. However, centres may exercise some flexibility in requiring compliance from children who have difficulties wearing masks/face shields, e.g. those with special needs. Instructors are expected to wear a surgical mask or reusable masks of equivalent effectiveness at all times.

      e. **Class timings**. Centres must allocate at least 15 minutes between classes. This is to allow adequate time to disinfect classroom surfaces, and to ensure strict separation of individuals from different classes. Parents are encouraged to drop off and pick up children promptly to avoid students lingering in waiting areas. Centres should also work out attendance and dismissal arrangements that help avoid congestion of individuals in or outside the centre. Parents are encouraged to drop off and pick up children promptly to avoid students lingering in waiting areas.

  - title: Some tuition and enrichment classes involve high movement activities (e.g. sports, dance), or activities which carry a higher risk of virus transmission through droplet spread (e.g. singing, wind/brass instruments). What additional safe management measures should be implemented?
    content: |
      The following additional safe management measures apply:
      
      <ins>Sports Classes</ins>

      Higher-risk facilities, such as indoor gyms and fitness/dance/exercise studios must be closed between 16 May 2021 and 13 Jun 2021 (dates inclusive), unless they only offer low intensity physical activities, sport and exercises, where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times, subject to capacity limits (no single room should hold more than 30 persons, including tutors/instructors). Outdoor exercise classes may continue. For detailed guidance, please refer to the advisory issued by [Sport Singapore](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/Newsroom/Media-Releases/2021/May/Further-Stricter-Safe-Management-Measures-For-Sport-And-Physical-Exercise-,-a-,-Activity){:target="_blank"}.

      <ins>Dance Classes</ins>

      Indoor dance classes may only proceed if they are able to adhere to additional safe management measures (including all participants and instructors wearing masks at all times, and further capacity limits; no single room should hold more than 30 persons, including tutors/instructors), as detailed in the advisory issued by the [National Arts Council](https://www.nac.gov.sg/whatwedo/support/sustaining-the-arts-during-covid-19/Safe-Management-Measures-for-the-Arts-and-Culture-Sector-.html){:target="_blank"}. Outdoor dance classes must comply with the measures in the advisory issued by issued by [Sport Singapore](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/Newsroom/Media-Releases/2021/May/Further-Stricter-Safe-Management-Measures-For-Sport-And-Physical-Exercise-,-a-,-Activity){:target="_blank"}. 

      <ins>Singing, Wind/Brass Instrument Classes</ ins>

      As in-person singing and wind/brass instrument classes involve a higher risk of virus transmission due to voice projection or intentional expulsion of air, they are to be suspended from 16 May to 13 Jun 2021 (dates inclusive).

      <ins>Voice Training, Speech and Drama Classes</ins>

      Voice training and speech and drama classes may continue, with all participants and instructors wearing masks at all times, subject to additional safe management measures and capacity limits (no single room should hold more than 30 persons, including tutors/instructors) as outlined in the National Arts Council’s advisory, available at [https://www.nac.gov.sg/whatwedo/support/sustaining-the-arts-during-covid-19/Safe-Management-Measures-for-the-Arts-and-Culture-Sector-.html](https://www.nac.gov.sg/whatwedo/support/sustaining-the-arts-during-covid-19/Safe-Management-Measures-for-the-Arts-and-Culture-Sector-.html){:target="_blank"}.

  - title: Will private tutors operating out of private residences be allowed to resume face-to-face lessons? 
    content: |
      While private tutors operating out of private residences have been allowed to resume lessons from Phase Two, i.e. from 19 June 2020, MOE strongly recommends that <ins>online lessons be the default arrangement</ins>, to reduce physical contact between individuals. 

      Home-based tuition/enrichment is subject to prevailing safe management measures for home-based services, including the cap of two distinct visitors allowed in the home per day. Such tutors must also use SafeEntry for visitors, to support contact tracing; if the tutor is awaiting the set-up of a SafeEntry account, s/he should maintain a manual log of visitors in the interim. 

      Parents and tutors should also adhere to prevailing safe distancing measures, i.e. they should ensure that students and tutors maintain safe distancing of at least 1m at all times, with strictly no physical interaction between individuals. If it is not possible to apply 1m safe distancing between students (e.g. in residences), tutors must limit classes to no more than two persons, including the tutor, with suitable spacing between individuals where possible. Home-based businesses registered with URA or HDB should adhere to the separate guidelines issued by the agencies on class sizes.

      Private tutors operating out of residences are also advised to put in place appropriate precautionary measures, and work with parents to ensure that they are comfortable with the measures taken. These should include:

        a.	Wearing of masks by all staff and students
        b.	Temperature screening and health declarations (tutors should turn away or not conduct tuition for persons who are unwell or have been issued with Approved Absence/Leave of Absence by their respective schools or Stay Home Notice/Home Quarantine Order by the authorities)
        c.	Clear record-keeping of staff/students to facilitate contact-tracing (Note: Where the tutor has to visit multiple places of residence, the tutor is expected to maintain a personal log of his/her activities, to facilitate contact tracing if necessary.)
        d.	Disinfection of surfaces between classes, if venue is hosted by tutor and shared by multiple students

      Individuals should also limit their overall number of social interactions, to not more than two per day, whether visiting another household or meeting with friends/family members/students in a public place. 

  - title: Are private schools, including tuition and enrichment centres, allowed to hold year-end concerts or performances on their premises?
    content: |
      All indoor live performances scheduled to take place 16 May through 13 Jun 2021 (dates inclusive) are to be deferred/ postponed to reduce the risk of transmission.

  - title: Will Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses for adults be allowed to continue?   
    content: |
      Yes, in-person training can continue for all CET activities at the Institutes of Higher Learning and by SSG-funded training providers. Notwithstanding this, online learning should be supported where feasible. 

      For health and safety reasons, the maximum class size for all CET activities is capped at 50 persons (including the trainer(s)). For SSG-funded CET programmes, SSG’s prevailing guideline for a maximum class size of 40 persons (excluding the trainer(s)) for course quality reasons remains and takes precedence. 

      As far as possible, training providers should ensure safe distancing of at least 1m between individuals at all times. Where not feasible or practical to do so, this 1m requirement can instead be enforced between groups, with each group made up of not more than **two** persons with effect from 16 May, and no mixing between different groups. There should be assigned seating in classrooms and other training venues where practicable. 

  - title: Will private tuition/enrichment classes and training sessions held in external venues (e.g. function rooms) be allowed to continue? 
    content: |
      MOE strongly recommends that <ins>telecommuting and online lessons be the default arrangement</ins>, to reduce physical contact between individuals. Notwithstanding this, private tuition/enrichment classes, and training sessions by the Institutes of Higher Learning and SSG-funded training providers, conducted at external venues can continue, if those venues are open. Such external venues may include condominium function rooms, private conference and meeting rooms, etc. 

      However, conduct of face-to-face lessons is subject to premise capacity caps and safe management measures. Private providers should approach premise owners for advice on the capacity caps for their respective venues. No single room should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors/trainers, further capacity limits for masked sports/dance/speech/voice training/drama classes, or the premise capacity cap, <ins>whichever is lower</ins>. 

      There should be a wipe-down regimen after each use at such external venues. Private providers must also adhere to the safe management guidelines for private tuition/enrichment and CET courses, which are outlined in the FAQs within this section. 

  - title: Can private tutors wear face shields instead of face masks during private tuition/enrichment lessons?
    content: |
      To reduce the risk of transmission, all tutors/instructors and students must wear surgical masks <ins>or reusable masks of equivalent effectiveness</ins> (not face shields) during private tuition/enrichment lessons, regardless of setting. 

  - title: Can tuition and enrichment centres switch to online learning even as face-to-face classes are permitted?
    content: |
      Yes, tuition and enrichment centres are encouraged to consider online lessons as the default arrangement during this period of heightened risk. Tuition and enrichment centres should review the safe management measures that they are able to put in place and can make their own business decisions regarding continuation of online learning, taking into consideration the efficacy of instruction and the needs and expectations of students/parents.

  - title: Can employees of private tuition and enrichment centres continue to work, even if centres have switched to online learning?
    content: |
      Tuition and enrichment centres are required to abide by the nationwide [safe management measures for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}. Tele-conferencing should be used in place of in-person meetings as far as possible. Where employees can perform their work by telecommuting from home, employers must ensure that they do so. 

  - title: In view of the recent case involving a private tutor, will MOE consider stopping private tuition or enrichment?
    content: |
      In line with the national posture, private tuition and enrichment may continue under Phase Two (Heightened Alert). Nonetheless, they are encouraged to consider online lessons as  the default arrangement during this period of heightened risk. Parents are encouraged to engage their child’s centre and assess if they are personally comfortable with the safe management measures taken, or if they would prefer to switch to online learning. 

  - title: Will the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system and the SafeEntry Gateway Device (SEGW) be implemented for tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers?
    content: |
      On 4 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced that TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (TT-only SafeEntry) will be implemented at all venues that experience higher throughput of visitors, and/or where people are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods from 17 May 2021. The TT programme and SafeEntry are important digital tools that enable contact tracers to quickly identify and isolate close contacts of COVID-19 cases. This helps to break transmission chains and prevent community outbreaks. TT tokens may be collected at designated collection points (please refer to [https://token.gowhere.gov.sg](https://token.gowhere.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} for more information).

      Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers must therefore ensure that TT-only SafeEntry is implemented in your premises from 17 May 2021, and that entry to your centres will be allowed only if the individual uses their TT App to scan the centre’s QR code or presents the QR code on the TT token to be scanned. This includes staff, students aged 7 years and above, parents and other visitors.

      From 15 June 2021, it is mandatory for all tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers to deploy SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) to facilitate SafeEntry (SE) check-in for students aged 7 years and above, parents, staff and visitors, and help users check that their TT token is working. Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers are reminded to download the SafeEntry (Business) app to use the SEGW function or register for a SEGW box on the SE website (go.gov.sg/gateway-overview). Centres should maintain attendance records for children below 7 to facilitate contact tracing if required.  

      At the point of entry into the centres, if any student forgets to bring their TT token, they should be asked to download the TT app on their phones before they are allowed entry. Individuals will only be granted entry with IDs as a last resort. 

      Between now and 17 May 2021, tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers must still be able to check in all visitors (including students and staff) with TT tokens, on top of existing check-in modes. Business may refer to the SafeEntry User Guide for requirements on how to scan the TT tokens, available at [https://www.safeentry.gov.sg](https://www.safeentry.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} (please navigate to Resources > User Guide > SafeEntry NRIC User Guide for Business). Updates may also be found at [https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/whats-new/press-releases](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/whats-new/press-releases){:target="_blank"}.

  - title: Will private tutors operating out of private residences be required to implement the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system?
    content: |
      As with tuition and enrichment centres (see Q9), private tutors operating out of private residences will need to implement TT-only SafeEntry.

  - title: Do private tutors need to be tested for COVID-19 before resuming face-to-face classes?
    content: |
      Anyone who is unwell, especially if they have a fever or display respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, breathlessness, runny nose, loss of sense of smell, cough, or sore throat, should see a doctor immediately.

      Private tutors do not need to be specifically tested for COVID-19. The need for surveillance testing is assessed based on different risk factors, including the risk of spread within the particular setting. Tutors and students should observe the safe management measures for private tuition and enrichment, which will minimise the degree of close interaction between staff and students.

  - title: How will the safe management measures for tuition and enrichment centres be enforced?
    content: |
      Enforcement Officers will conduct checks on centres to ensure compliance. We will also act on feedback from the public.

  - title: What will happen if a private provider of tuition and enrichment classes does not comply with safe management measures?
    content: |
      Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020, errant providers may be issued a notice of composition for their 1st and 2nd offences ($1,000 and $2,000 respectively) and are subject to prosecution from the 3rd offence onwards.

      We strongly urge all private providers to exercise social responsibility, and to abide by the Safe Management Measures.
