    - title: How long will these measures last for?
      content: |
        These measures will take effect from 16 May 2021 through 13 June 2021. However, this may be extended if the situation does not improve.

    - title: Why is there a need for the Government to further tighten F&B and other Retail operations?
      content: |
        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation. The number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and unlinked community cases has continued to increase. To this end, the measures are needed to decisively arrest the increasing number of cases in the community.

    - title: Are employees allowed to continue to work in office?
      content: |
        Work-from-home will be the default at workplaces. Employers must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so. 

        There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites. Employers should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours. 

        Social gatherings at the workplace will not be allowed. Employees may have meal breaks at the workplace, but refrain from intermingling with their colleagues when their masks are taken off.

    - title: These additional measures have impacted my business greatly. How is the Government supporting us?
      content: |
        (i)	<u>Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for F&B firms</u>
        In view of the cessation of dining-in at F&B establishments, the Government will increase the JSS support rate to 50% of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to local employees during the period for which dining-in is prohibited. This is an increase from the 10% support for wages paid up to June 2021.

        (ii)	<u>One-month rental relief for hawker centres and coffeeshops on Government-owned premises</u>
        To support hawkers and coffeeshop stallholders, who are self-employed and do not benefit from the JSS, the Government will provide one month of rental waiver for hawker stall and coffeeshop tenants of Government agencies. Commercial landlords are urged to support their F&B tenants through this period.

    - title: Will there be updates on the GoBusiness portal for businesses, e.g. what are the permissible activities?
      content: |
        Please refer to the Safe Management Measures and guidelines stipulated in the sector-specific advisories on the GoBusiness portal.

    - title: Am I allowed to operate at full capacity during this time?  Or must we limit work to specific hours or at certain manpower limits?
      content: |
        Employers must ensure that all employees who are able to work from home do so. For those that are unable to work from home, employers should stagger start times and allow flexible workplace hours. Employees should not be cross deployed to other worksites. 

        Special attention should be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. older workers, pregnant workers, and those with underlying medical conditions) to enable them to work from home. For these employees, you could consider temporarily redeploying them to another role within the company so that they are able to telecommute or work from home.

    - title: Is there a minimum percentage or number of workers that employers must place on work-from-home-arrangements?
      content: |
        The objective of the requirements is to reduce physical interactions in the workplace in order to minimise spread of COVID-19. Employers should focus on providing the facilities necessary and directing every worker to work from home, as far as reasonably practicable. The proportion of employees that can do so will vary in different workplaces and sectors due to differing operational requirements. 

        The onus is on employers to show that they have made a reasonable effort to facilitate working from home, including reviewing and transforming business processes through technology to support remote working e.g. e-payment, e-invoicing, e-signatures. In this regard, you may refer to MOM’s [list of resources](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-a-resources-to-assist-companies.pdf?la=en&hash=A49779E587B330C7702C3A4B33401D85){:target="_blank"} that include technology solutions and grants available to assist companies.

    - title: Are companies that are operating required to ensure that their employees work from home?
      content: |
        From 16 May 2021 to 13 Jun 2021, work-from-home is the default mode of work and employers must provide the necessary facilities and direct their employees to work from home wherever possible.  

        Work-from-home measures should be implemented in a sustainable manner that enables employees to maintain work-life harmony while continuing to meet business needs. The [tripartite advisory on mental well-being at workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/tripartite-advisory-on-mental-well-being-at-workplaces){:target="_blank"} sets out practical guidance on measures that employers can adopt to support their employees’ mental well-being. 

        A list of resources such as technology solutions and grants available to assist companies is available [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-a-resources-to-assist-companies.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

        Enforcement checks will be conducted and actions will be taken against businesses for non-compliance.

        (i)	While customers and delivery personnel are allowed to enter the premises of the F&B establishments for takeaway or delivery, they must leave the premises once they have picked up their orders.

        (ii)	During this period, F&B establishments should cancel all events and promotions that will generate crowding at their physical premises in a manner which is non-compliant with the SMMs.

        F&B establishments may serve as venues for wedding solemnisations and/or work-related events by third parties and are required to comply with the SMMs for these events. **However, as wedding receptions are not allowed, food and drinks are not permitted to be served at wedding solemnisations. Food and drinks are also not allowed at work-related events.**

    - title: Can staff and food handlers have their meals at the food outlets?
      content: |
        Employees of F&B establishments may consume their meals at the F&B premises. This includes all F&B establishments such as those in shopping malls, industrial estates, coffeeshops and hawker centres. Malls may designate spaces for mall employees to consume their meals. 

        However, the F&B establishment must ensure that the following safe distancing measures are observed:

        (i)	Designate and clearly demarcate a dining area for staff only. The designated area should be out of public view wherever possible.
        
        (ii)	Stagger employees’ meal times.
        
        (iii)	Employees must dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from any other individual. They should refrain from interacting with other individuals.

        It can only serve takeaway and/or delivery orders only. No dine-in service is permitted. Customers are not permitted to consume any food or drinks on-site whilst waiting for the food to be prepared.

    - title: Are F&B establishments still required to put in place contact tracing and temperature screening for customers, now that they can only provide takeaway services?
      content: |
        As dine-in services are not allowed, F&B establishments are not required to implement SafeEntry for customers. However, all F&B establishments (including those with no dine-in services) must require their staff and vendors to do SafeEntry check-in. They must transit to TraceTogether-only SafeEntry when this is implemented from 17 May 2021.

        Staff at these outlets should also be trained to communicate good practices to customers (e.g. avoid forming clusters or join the demarcated queue lines while waiting for food). You can also put up signage to communicate these messages. 

    - title: Must a food delivery personnel wear a mask at all times?
      content: |
        A food delivery personnel must wear a mask at all times in the course of their work.

        The only two exceptions are when he/she is cycling to deliver food. A mask must be worn once he/she completes cycling.

    - title: Can work-related events continue to be held at F&B establishments?
      content: |
        Employers should avoid organising work-related events unless critical. All work-related events that proceed (both non customer-facing and customer-facing) can be held within the workplace premise and third-party venues such as F&B establishments. 

        However, event organisers are required to comply with the following guidelines: 

        (i)	Non customer-facing events (e.g. conferences, seminars):

          b.	At least one-metre spacing between individuals must be maintained at all times.
          
          c.	Food and drinks are not allowed. 
          
          d.	Prevailing SMMs as indicated in MOM’s Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the workplace continue to apply.

        (ii)	Customer-facing events (e.g. product launches, marketing events):  
          
          a.	Events organised by F&B establishments within their own F&B premises are subject to the maximum number of individuals that the venue may accommodate after safe distancing measures are adhered to.
          
          b.	Events organised by external parties at F&B establishments (where the F&B premises now function as a third-party venue) are subject to a cap of 50 persons (excluding service staff) or a lower number, depending on venue capacity and safe distancing requirements.
          
          c.	Food and drinks are not allowed.

    - title: How can supermarket manage queues now that the tightening of measures may result in more people buying groceries to cook at home?
      content: |
        Supermarket retailers should implement other crowd management measures (e.g. limiting the number of shoppers within the store at any one time) to ensure that one metre spacing can be maintained between shoppers. They would also need to limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 2 persons, as well as maintain orderly queues in-store, and at entrance to store.

        Supermarkets are also encouraged to provide dedicated shopping hours for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and pregnant women. This can help to reduce intermingling to better protect those who are more vulnerable to COVID-19.
