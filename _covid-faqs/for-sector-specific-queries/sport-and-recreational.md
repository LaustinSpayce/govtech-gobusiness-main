  - title: Are sport and recreational facilities opened to the public?  
    content: |
      Based on the Multi-Ministerial Taskforce’s announcement on 15 June 2020, all sport and recreational facilities, including but not limited to swimming pools, stadiums, studios, gyms, indoor sport halls, hardcourts, bowling centres, and function rooms, may be opened from Phase Two.

  - title: Can I open my private gym or fitness facilities to the public?   
    content: |
      According to the Multi-Ministerial Taskforce’s announcement on 15 June 2020, all sport and recreational facilities, including but not limited to swimming pools, stadiums, studios, gyms, indoor sport halls, hardcourts, bowling centres, and function rooms, may be opened from Phase Two.

  - title: Can I admit more than 50 persons in my facility?    
    content: |  
      All sport and recreational facilities is limited to 8 Sqm per person based on its Gross Floor Area or 50 persons, whichever is lower. Staff on the premises is not included as part of the maximum capacity of 8 Sqm per person or 50 persons. Facilities that need to admit more than 50 persons can apply for approval by Sport Singapore via email at <https://members.myactivesg.com/feedback>{:target="_blank"}.    

  - title: My facility is less than 50 Sqm, what is the maximum capacity?     
    content: |
      Facilities up to 50 Sqm can admit up to eight persons. For example, a 20 Sqm facility can accommodate eight persons, excluding staff. Facility operators have to ensure that the physical distancing measures are observed. These parameters will be reviewed from time to time, and more may be allowed at a later juncture in Phase Three.

  - title: I operate a large venue with multiple sport facilities including swimming pools, gymnasium, F&B outlet and golf driving range, are they considered separate facilities for the purpose of establishing the capacity limit?     
    content: |
      The principle is that there should not be congregation of more than 50 persons in any particular space. If the facilities can be managed separately such that there is no mixing of the users of the different facilities, they may be considered as separate facilities for this purpose.

      For example, a function room used for Zumba class, the restaurant, the swimming pool and the gymnasium in a country club may be dealt with separately. A system for managing access to these places should be established to ensure adherence.         

  - title: I am a private coach, can I conduct 1-to-1 or group coaching?    
    content: |  
      Yes, coaching and organised programmes and classes of no more than eight participants is allowed. An additional coach or instructor is allowed and will not be considered as part of the group size of eight. A physicial distancing of 2m (i.e. 2 arms-length) between individuals should be maintained at all times

  - title: How far apart must the equipment in my gym be placed?      
    content: |  
      Equipment is placed and used such that there is a two metre distance between users.

  - title: I run a yoga studio. What are some of the safe management measures that I need to take note of?     
    content: |  
      Some safe management measures (SMMs) for yoga studios include adhering to the maximum facility capacity, limiting group activities to no more than eight participants  per group, as well as maintaining 3m between different groups and ensuring no intermixing between different groups.

  - title: Can TeamSG athletes return to training?     
    content: |        
      Yes. All organised trainings and exercise are permitted in Phase Three, but groups must be kept to no more than eight persons. An additional coach is allowed and will not be part of the group size of eight.
