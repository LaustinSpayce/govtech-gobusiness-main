  - title: What constitutes a MICE event?
    content: |
      MICE events refer to business-oriented events such as meetings, conferences and exhibitions arranged or held in the course of business<sup>3</sup> with more than 50 participants which are not held for consumers to attend. Events that are substantially social, recreational, political or religious in character, such as company D&Ds, networking events or gala dinners, do not fall within the MICE events contemplated here. 
      
      Following the Multi-Ministry Taskforce’s (MTF) announcement on 24 March 2021 on the launch of the pre-event testing (PET) framework, businesses can apply to the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to organise the following pilot events:
      
      i.	B2B events with more than 250 but no more than 750 participants at a time, with PET for all participants;  
      ii.	B2B events with more than 50 but no more than 250 participants at a time.

      With effect from 24 April 2021, Event Organisers (EOs) can also apply to organise B2B events where cohorting into sub-cohorts of 20 pax is no longer required.

      |B2B events of up to 250 pax at a time|B2B events of up to 750 pax at a time|
      |Up to 50 pax per zone Safe distancing of at least 1metre between individuals at all times|
      |PET required for all foreign participants who are on a Controlled Itinerary*, and any local residents and Business Travel Pass (BTP) holders with recent travel history (i.e. within the last 14 days).|PET required for all participants. Local residents who have completed the full COVID-19 vaccination regimen (with a further two weeks from the second dose to develop sufficient protection) are exempted from pre-event testing. More information on PET exemptions can be found at [https://go.gov.sg/pet](https://go.gov.sg/pet){:target="_blank"}.|

      All B2B event applications with more than 50 participants must be submitted to STB for approval by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).  EOs must demonstrate their ability to implement the rigorous Safe Management Measures (SMMs) under STB’s Safe Business Events (SBE) framework<sup>4</sup>. 

      Work-related events also do not fall within the MICE events contemplated here. These include consumer-facing events (such as product launches, marketing / branding events) and work meetings (among colleagues or with external parties), training, board meetings, HR talks, townhalls, seminars, corporate retreats, Annual/Extraordinary General Meetings, tender briefings to vendors and award ceremonies. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) had previously announced that work-related events of up to 50 persons are permitted to be held outside of workplaces/own premises with effect from 22 October 2020. More details on the MTF’s announcement can be found [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/roadmap-to-phase-three){:target="_blank"}. FAQs on the Ministry of Manpower’s Workplace SMMs can be found [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}.

      <sup>3</sup> (a) to discuss or negotiate matters relating to trade, commerce or finance, professional practice or matters, health, arts, science, technology, industry, economics, industrial relations, security, international affairs, the environment or any other cause or matter, whether or not of a similar kind; (b) to temporarily exhibit or display goods of any kind for the purposes of sale or supply; or (c) to promote the trading of goods or the provision of services. 

      <sup>4</sup> Under STB’s Safe Business Events framework introduced in July 2020 for events of up to 50 participants, EOs must achieve five key outcomes. The framework was created in consultation with the industry and is aligned with international best practices.

  - title: When will MICE events be allowed to resume? Can I apply to do so?
    content: |
      Since 1 October 2020, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has been accepting applications for Event Organisers and Event Venues (collectively, EOs)<sup>5</sup> to pilot MICE events with up to 250 persons (5 zones of 50 persons), subject to these and other Safe Management Measures (SMMs) imposed in this document or by the Control Order<sup>6</sup>. 

      As of March 2021, more than 60 MICE event pilots have been trialled under the Safe Business Events framework, with over 9,000 local and foreign participants and no incidence of COVID-19 infections arising from such events. STB will be expanding the MICE event pilot phase by allowing larger operating capacities for MICE events.

      From 24 April 2021, STB has started accepting applications for EOs to pilot MICE events with a total operating capacity of up to 750 individuals per session (15 zones of 50 persons) in accordance with the Safe Business Events framework [here](https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/home-pages/advisory-for-MICE.html#MICE){:target="_blank"}. In addition, cohorting into sub-cohorts of 20 pax is no longer required.

      <sup>5</sup> The “EOs” refer to any person (including business entities) that has —
      (i)the charge, management or control of the MICE event venue (or the part of a MICE event venue) either on their own account or as agent of another person; or 
      (ii)the use temporarily or otherwise of the MICE event venue (or the part of the MICE event venue). To avoid doubt, there can be different occupiers for different parts of the MICE event venue.  

      <sup>6</sup> “Control Order” refers to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 (found at https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/COVID19TMA2020-S254-2020), the COVID 19 (Temporary Measures) (Major Business Events — Control Order) Regulations 2021  (found at https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL-Supp/S278-2021/Published/20210423?DocDate=20210423) and, where applicable, the COVID 19 (Temporary Measures) (Performances and Other Activities — Control Order) Regulations 2020 (found at https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/COVID19TMA2020-S927-2020).  

  - title: What is the role of the Event Organiser and Event Venue? Who would be penalised if Safe Management Measures (SMMs) are contravened?
    content: |    
      Both the Event Organiser and Event Venue are jointly responsible for the events taking place under their purview. If SMMs are contravened, Enforcement Officers will investigate the facts and circumstances to determine which party is liable, or if both parties are liable.
