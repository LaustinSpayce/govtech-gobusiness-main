  - title: Are staycations allowed?
    content: |
      Hotels may apply to STB to resume the provision of accommodation to guests for the purposes of leisure (e.g. staycations). Any hotel that wishes to apply must comply with the safe management measures required for hotels. Please refer to the advisory for [hotels](https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/home-pages/advisory-for-hotels.html){:target="_blank"} for the full list of requirements.

      Hotels must submit their application to STB for assessment. Hotels may resume the provision of accommodation to guests for the purposes of leisure and related marketing efforts only after receiving approval from MTI.

      The list of approved hotels can be found at [here](https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/home-pages/permitted-tourism-businesses.html){:target="_blank"}.

      Marriage Solemnizations and wedding receptions in Hotel venues are limited to 100 persons excluding Solemnizers, vendors and premises staff (to be kept to minimum required).

      Classes and training by permitted enterprises conducting an education business  must be limited to no more than 50 individuals including the trainer(s). Safe management measures must be implemented, including ensuring at least 1 metre safe distance between all individuals, or if individuals must be less than 1 metre apart, they should be in groups of no more than 8, with at least 1 metre distance between groups. A record of the groups of 8 must be kept for not less than 28 days after the day the record is made.

      With effect from 22 October 2020, work-related events are permitted to be held outside of workplaces/own premises, with up to 50 persons at any time or the maximum number of individuals which the room or venue may accommodate if there is a distance of  at least 1 metre between any 2 individuals, whichever is lower; and at least 1 metre spacing between individuals at all times.

  - title: Once a hotel has received approval to re-open for staycations, does it have to submit a separate application to re-open other businesses (e.g. F&B, spas, pools, gyms) within its premises?
    content: |
      A separate application for General Exemption is not required. Once a hotel receives approval from MTI to re-open for staycations, they are only required to submit via GoBusiness website the collective number of workers who are working on-site at the various facilities. This will need to be done within 2 weeks of the date of resumption of on-site operations for staycations.
