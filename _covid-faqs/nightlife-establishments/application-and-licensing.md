  - title: How can I change my nightlife operations to activities that are permitted today? What kind of licences are required?
    content: |
      Nightlife operators that wish to convert to F&B operations should first register their interest with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (“MTI”) through the Singapore Nightlife Business Association (“SNBA”) at <helpdesk@snba.org.sg>{:target="_blank"} This would allow us to prioritise your subsequent regulatory submissions to the relevant agencies.

      Operators that wish to pivot to other commercial uses should submit their change of use application directly to Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) through the [GoBusiness portal](/licences/).

      Prior to making any application, nightlife operators are strongly encouraged to read the advisory note here [last updated 6 Nov].

  - title: Do nightlife businesses need to change their Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) code if they are changing business activity?
    content: |
      Nightlife businesses are required to change their SSIC code if their current code is not reflective of their new business activity. Operators who have converted to permitted activities should notify Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) by updating the changes of their company’s information on BizFile+ within 14 days. You may login with your Singpass [here](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}.

  - title: How long will the application for converting to a permitted activity take?
    content: |
      The process to acquire the necessary licences and approvals from relevant agencies to change to F&B operations will take approximately two weeks from the date of submission of a completed application. If there are substantial changes to your layout for changing to a restaurant or other commercial use, the process may take longer, depending on the type of renovation required.

  - title: What is URA’s one-year temporary conversion?
    content: |
      The government understands operators’ concern that they may not be able to revert to their original activity once they pivot to other business activities. Hence, URA will allow nightlife establishments that choose to pivot to F&B from now till 31 March 2021 to revert to their original activity, provided such uses are permitted to operate under the prevailing COVID-19 regulations, and that the premises are not located in selected exclusion areas where this temporary conversion does not apply. Operators are to ensure that the premise has valid approvals / licences for the last approved use before reverting to their former nightlife operations.

      For approved plans to change to commercial uses other than F&B establishments, subsequent reversions to the original use would depend on the prevailing guidelines and site context at that point in time.

 time of reversion, the smoking room must remain close until a valid PEL is obtained.
