    - title: Who do the requirements for Safe Management Measures apply to?
      content: |
        All businesses allowed to operate are required to comply with the Safe Management Measures (SMMs) for workplaces as well as the SMMs for their sector/activity. 

    - title: What are the key changes for Safe Management Measures at the workplace that will take effect from 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021?
      content: |
        Work-from-home is the default mode of work. All employees whose functions can be performed remotely must work from home. Employers must provide the necessary facilities and direct their employees to work from home wherever possible. Employees who are unable to work from home, for reasons due to the nature of their work (e.g. their work can only be done with equipment that is confined to the workplace) can continue working on-site.
        
        Social gatherings at the workplace are disallowed. Employees should have their meal breaks at the workplace individually.

    - title: Are Safe Management Measures mandatory, and what enforcement actions will MOM take against businesses that do not implement it?
      content: |
        MOM and sector agencies will take enforcement actions for non-compliance of Safe Management Measures. For workplaces that severely lack Safe Management Measures, MOM will direct employers to stop operations at the workplace. Employers will have to take steps to ensure that Safe Management Measures are in place before operations can resume.
        
        Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, failure to comply with Safe Management Measures is punishable with a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to 6 months, or both. Repeated non-compliance is punishable with a fine of up to $20,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both.

    - title: Who is empowered to enforce the requirements and how can I verify the identity of enforcement officers inspecting my workplace?
      content: |
        Enforcement action may be taken by any of the following persons under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act:
        
        - A police officer;
        
        - A Health Officer appointed under section 4(1)(a) or (b) of the Infectious Diseases Act;
        
        - A public officer;
        
        - An officer of a statutory body;
        
        - An auxiliary police officer; and
        
        - An employee of a prescribed institution under the Infectious Diseases Act.

        You can verify the identity of enforcement officers via their authority cards or their public service identification cards.

    - title: Where can I find more guidance on implementing Safe Management Measures in the workplace?
      content: |
        You may refer to the Checklist of Safe Management Measures at the Workplace for Resumption of Business Activities [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-b-checklist-of-safe-management-measures.pdf){:target="_blank"}, for an overview of the requirements that must be fulfilled prior to resuming business activities at the workplace. For more information, please refer [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}.

    - title: We have received two advisories, one from MOM and another from the sector agency. Which one do we follow?  
      content: |
        The [advisory on Safe Management Measures and the accompanying checklist](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"} issued by MOM are for workplaces in general. Where there may be sector-specific considerations, companies should also refer to the sector-specific advisories issued. All businesses are required to comply with the Safe Management Measures (SMMs) for workplaces issued by MOM as well as the SMMs for their sector/activity. 

    - title: My employees do not have a specific workplace as they are deployed to client’s site to provide goods and services. How can I implement Safe Management Measures?
      content: |
        All employers must implement Safe Management Measures at their workplaces for all employees and contractors. 

        Companies that have employees deployed to other sites should also ensure that their employees comply with the Safe Management Measures put in place at these sites. In fact, some of the Safe Management Measures can be implemented by employers regardless of where employees are deployed, such as health monitoring.

    - title: Are companies that are operating required to ensure that their employees work from home?
      content: |
        From 16 May 2021 to 13 Jun 2021, work-from-home is the default mode of work and employers must provide the necessary facilities and direct their employees to work from home wherever possible.

        Work-from-home measures should be implemented in a sustainable manner that enables employees to maintain work-life harmony while continuing to meet business needs. The [tripartite advisory on mental well-being at workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/tripartite-advisory-on-mental-well-being-at-workplaces){:target="_blank"} sets out practical guidance on measures that employers can adopt to support their employees’ mental well-being. 

        A list of resources such as technology solutions and grants available to assist companies is available [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-a-resources-to-assist-companies.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

        Enforcement checks will be conducted and actions will be taken against businesses for non-compliance. 

    - title: Is there a minimum percentage or number of workers that employers must place on work-from-home arrangements?
      content: |
        The objective of the requirements is to reduce physical interactions in the workplace in order to minimise spread of COVID-19. Employers should focus on providing the facilities necessary and directing every worker to work from home, as far as reasonably practicable. The proportion of employees that can do so will vary in different workplaces and sectors due to differing operational requirements. 

        The onus is on employers to show that they have made a reasonable effort to facilitate working from home, including reviewing and transforming business processes through technology to support remote working e.g. e-payment, e-invoicing, e-signatures. 

    - title: Should my employees wear masks at all times? What should I do if my employee has a medical condition?
      content: |
        Everyone at the workplace should wear a mask at all times, except when eating, drinking, consuming medication or engaging in strenuous physical exercise. 

        However, if your employee has severe medical conditions which do not make it possible to wear a mask, they can wear a face shield in lieu of a mask. 

    - title: What should I do if my employees are unwilling to work from home because their home is not conducive for work?
      content: |
        The objective of these regulations is to reduce physical interactions in order to prevent spread of COVID-19. Employers can consider different ways to implement working arrangements that comply with the Safe Management Measures for the workplace, while taking business and employee preferences into account.

    - title: As most of my employees are either doing frontline work or fieldwork operations, it is not feasible for me to rearrange the work such that they can work-from-home. Will I be penalised for not providing such work arrangements?
      content: |
        Employers must demonstrate the business or operational reasons why the workers working at the workplace are unable to work-from-home despite review and redesign of work processes. Inspectors will assess the efforts put in by companies to implement work-from-home arrangements based on the practicality of whether the workers can work-from-home given the nature of the job.

        For the safety of workers at the workplace, employers should put in place other Safe Management Measures at the workplace (e.g. ensuring safe distancing, ensuring use of SafeEntry, etc.) to provide a safe working environment and minimize risk of further outbreaks. 

        Special attention should also be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. persons who are aged 60 and above, and patients who are immunocompromised or have concurrent medical conditions) to enable them to work-from-home. Employers are encouraged to enable these employees to work-from-home, allow them to travel to/from work at off-peak timings, temporarily redeploy them to another role within the company, or take other appropriate measures to reduce their exposure to infection risk.

    - title: Is there a limit on the number of attendees in a physical meeting?
      content: |
        Employers should conduct virtual meetings as far as possible. Where physical meetings are assessed to be necessary, they are subject to a cap of 50 physical attendees and there must be 1m safe distancing between all individuals. Attendees must be masked.

    - title: Are companies required to ensure staggered start times and implement flexible workplace hours for employees at the workplace?
      content: |
        Employers are encouraged to stagger the start times for all employees who are unable to work from home (due to the nature of their work, or their work can only be done with equipment that is confined to the workplace) such that at least half of all employees arrive at the workplace at or after 10am, as far as possible. This would enable more employees to avoid peak-hour travel, especially if employees require the use of public transport. Timings of lunch and other breaks should also be staggered accordingly.

    - title: Can I carry on with the work-related event I have planned between 16 May and 13 June, given the tighter measures that were announced for this period? 
      content: |
        Employers are strongly encouraged to consider rescheduling or convert to virtual those work-related events that are not critical, in view of the recent trends in community transmission of COVID-19. 

        If employers assess that the physical work-related event is critical, they may proceed with strict implementation of SMM.  

        i.	The number of persons per event must be capped at 50 persons to limit the risk of exposure to infection.
        
        ii.	Attendees must maintain at least 1 metre safe distancing between individual attendees, as per the requirement at the workplace.
        
        iii.	Food and drinks are not allowed at work-related events.

    - title: How do I know if my foreign workers can leave their residence for work?
      content: |
        You can now use the AccessCode on the SGWorkPass app to check if your foreign employees can leave their residence (dormitory or non-dormitory housing) for work. The status of your employees' AccessCode takes into account 3 broad parameters:
        - Their health
        
        - Their residential address
        
        - Whether your company and/or worker is allowed to operate

        They can only leave for work if their AccessCode is 'Green' (can go out for work).
        
        However, if their AccessCode is 'Red' (cannot go out for work), they are not allowed to leave for work.

    - title: Am I able to access all my workers' AccessCode status and details, instead of checking individually using the SGWorkPass?
      content: |
        From 12 July 2020, employers can download the AccessCode details of their workers from a new [Safe@Work eService](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/safe-work){:target="_blank"}. For a start, AccessCode statuses of workers who hold a Work Permit or S Pass will be available. 

        Please refer to the [Safe@Work eService onboarding guide](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/safety-health/user-guides/safe-work/user-guide-safe-work.pdf?la=en&hash=58E40C481AF9D908461569E56A92AD6D){:target="_blank"} for more information.

        This means your company has not been given approval to operate, and/or your workers are not allowed to start work.

        All companies should check the [GoBusiness Portal](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/covid/){:target="_blank"} to find out if they are allowed to operate. Please approach your respective lead agencies for assistance:

        |Sector your company is in|Who to approach?|
        |Construction|Building and Construction Authority (BCA)</br>If your worker's AccessCode details show 'No approval to start work', it could be because:</br>•	Your company has not submitted project or workers to BCA for approval</br>•	Your company has obtained BCA's approval, but:</br>•	Your project did not include the worker in the submission for approval</br>•	There is missing/wrong worker's information in the submission (e.g. wrong FIN/UEN or FIN entered is not under the employment of the UEN entered)</br>For the above scenario, please submit/resubmit an application for construction/supply works at BCA's website.

    - title: How do I update my foreign employee’s residential address?
      content: |
        You can update their residential address using: 

        - [Online Foreign Worker Address Service (OFWAS)](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/ofwas){:target="_blank"} for Work Permit holders
        - [EP Online](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/ep-online){:target="_blank"} for Employment Pass and S Pass holders 

        Their AccessCode will be refreshed 1 - 2 days after their addresses are updated in OFWAS or EP Online. If their AccessCode is not refreshed, it may mean:
        
        - Your worker has failed to scan the QR code in his room using the FWMOMCare App; or
        - the dormitory operators' record is not updated. Please contact the dormitory operator to rectify this.

    - title: What can employees of firms which are not allowed to operate do, if they are told to leave the company due to refusal to report to work?  
      content: |
        Employees who have been wrongfully dismissed may file a claim against the wrongful dismissal or make a phone advisory appointment with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) at [https://www.tal.sg/tadm/eServices](https://www.tal.sg/tadm/eServices){:target="_blank"}. 

        For more information on what constitutes a wrongful dismissal, please refer to the [Tripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/termination-of-employment/unfair-dismissal#what-is-a-wrongful-dismissal){:target="_blank"}. 

    - title: Can my workers who are staying in dormitories walk or take their own personal transport (e.g. bicycle, motorcycles) to and from their worksites?
      content: |
        As an employer, you must provide transport for your workers to and from their worksites.

        If the worksite is located nearby (e.g. <1km away) and there are no community areas en-route, you can allow your worker to walk or cycle.

        When allowing workers to walk or cycle between dormitories and worksites, you must demonstrate that you have complied with the relevant safe management measures upon request by enforcement officers. You must ensure that your workers wear their masks at all times, and that they only travel to and from their worksites with no stops in between.

        Workers are not allowed to ride motorcycles to and from their worksites under any circumstances.

        More details on implementing safe management measures for workers on employer-provided transportation can be found [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-safe-management-measures-for-workers-on-transportation){:target="_blank"}.

    - title: Can my workers who are staying in dormitories take taxis or private hire vehicles (e.g. Grab, GoJek) to and from their worksites?
      content: |
        As an employer, you must provide transport for your workers to and from their worksites.

        You can use taxis or private hire vehicles (PHVs) as long as you:

        - Work with taxi or PHV operators to pre-arrange and pre-pay for such vehicles to ferry the workers to ensure availability of vehicles and reduce physical interactions between drivers and workers.

        - Work with dormitory operators to plan and coordinate pick-up times so as to reduce congestion.

        AND

        - Are able to demonstrate that you have complied with the relevant safe management measures upon request.

        You must ensure that your workers wear their masks at all times, check in using SafeEntry, and that they go directly to and from their worksites with no stops in between.

        More details on implementing safe management measures for workers on employer-provided transportation can be found [here](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-safe-management-measures-for-workers-on-transportation){:target="_blank"}.
