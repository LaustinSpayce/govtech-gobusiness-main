  - title: How do I know if my company is allowed to resume operations?
    content: |
      The lists of businesses that may operate, and their SSIC codes, can be found <a href="/images/covid/Permittedserviceslist2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Businesses on these lists do not need to apply to Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) for exemption before resuming operations. They are required to log in to GoBusiness and submit the number of on-site workers they have, within two weeks of the date of resumption of operations.

      If you cannot recall your company’s primary SSIC code or are unsure of what your business activity is classified as, you can log in to <a href="https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/" target="_blank">BizFile+</a> with your CorpPass to retrieve your primary SSIC code. You can then look for it on the list of permitted services.
  - title: If my business activities are not on the list of permitted services, can I apply for an exemption to resume business activities?
    content: |
      Businesses should suspend operations in their premises until they are approved by Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) to continue operations or their business activity gets added to the list of permitted services here.

      If employees have to return to the workplace for short periods of time (ie: less than a day), employers are required to apply to MTI for a time-limited exemption here. If employers need to maintain a skeletal workforce at the workplace for longer periods, they need to apply for a general exemption <a href="https://form.gov.sg/#!/5ed05c2cde28b7001163f2f2" target="_blank">here</a>.
  - title: My General Exemption was previously approved but my companies’ activities are not on the   permitted services list. Will I be able to continue operations? Can our employees who are currently working from home return to the workplace?
    content: |
      Companies operating under a General Exemption must submit an application on GoBusiness for more employees to return to the workplace.

      Please note that for employees whose jobs can be performed from home, employers must ensure that they continue to do so for at least half their working time, measured over a reasonable period of time not exceeding four weeks. In addition, no more than half of employees who are able to work from home are allowed to be at the workplace at any point in time.
  - title: I received an email notification that my exemption had been rescinded, but my company falls under the list of permitted services. Will I be able to resume operations?
    content: |
      Yes. If your company's activities are on the list of permitted services, you will be allowed to resume operations. If your company has other business functions or services that are not on the list of permitted services, these business functions or services must remain suspended until further notice.
  - title: My company’s activities are not on the list of permitted services, but we support a permitted service that is listed. Can I appeal?
    content: |
      If your company needs to support a permitted service, please submit an application for a General Exemption or a Time-Limited Exemption on GoBusiness <a href="https://form.gov.sg/#!/5ed05c2cde28b7001163f2f2" target="_blank">here</a>.

      You will only be allowed to operate when your General Exemption or Time-Limited Exemption is approved.
  - title: Are there any requirements that I need to fulfil before I can resume operations?
    content: |
      All businesses that are resuming operations must fulfil stringent safe management measures, as well as comply with any sector-specific requirements relevant to their business, before resuming operations. Please read about these requirements <a href="/safemanagement/general/">here</a>.

      Businesses that belong to the list of permitted services must declare the number of workers who are working onsite using GoBusiness **within 2 weeks of the date of resumption of operations**.

      Businesses with an approved General Exemption to resume operations must declare the number of workers who are working onsite **within 2 days of resuming operations**.
  - title: If my company’s activities are on the list of permitted services, will I be able to resume all my business functions?
    content: |
      If your company has other business functions or services that are not on the list of permitted services, these business functions or services must remain suspended until further notice.
  - title: I operate multiple business activities and have more than one Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) code tagged to my business. Which code should I refer to?
    content: |
      You should refer to the SSIC code for your primary business activity and see if it's on the list of permitted services that can resume operations <a href="/permittedlist/">here</a>.
  - title: I have more than one Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) code tagged to my business. If my primary activity is not on the list of permitted services, but my secondary activity is, will I still be allowed to resume operations?
    content: |
      No. You may resume operations only if the SSIC code for your primary business activity is on the list of permitted services that can resume operations. However, if you intend to only carry out the secondary activity and not the primary activity, you may apply for a General Exemption <a href="https://form.gov.sg/#!/5ed05c2cde28b7001163f2f2" target="_blank">here</a>.
  - title: My company is carrying out an activity on the list of permitted services. However, my SSIC code does not match the listed code on the website. Will I still be allowed to resume operations?
    content: |
      You will need to apply for a General Exemption <a href="https://form.gov.sg/#!/5ed05c2cde28b7001163f2f2" target="_blank">here</a> and receive approval before resuming operations.
  - title: I am a freelancer and do not have a Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) code. How do I know if I can resume service?
    content: |
      Freelancers have to be registered with ACRA, unless the business is carried out under your full name as reflected in your NRIC.

      If the business is carried out under your full name as reflected in your NRIC, you can include a description of your business and search for the corresponding SSIC code on BizFile+ <a href="https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/ngbbizfileinternet/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pages/BizfileHomepage.jspx" target="_blank">here</a>. Once you have retrieved your SSIC code, please check if it's on the list of permitted services that can resume operations <a href="https://form.gov.sg/#!/5ed05c2cde28b7001163f2f2" target="_blank">here</a>.
  - title: I am running a society/organisation which does not need to be registered with ACRA. Can we resume our activities?
    content: |
      All membership organisations which are registered with the Registry of Societies are allowed to resume their onsite activities, provided they follow safe management measures and any sector-specific requirements relevant to their activities. Please read about these requirements <a href="/safemanagement/general/" target="_blank">here</a>.
  - title: What is the penalty if my company is found operating when we are not allowed to do so?
    content: |
      Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, first-time offenders found operating will face a fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Subsequent offences may face a fine of up to $20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.
  - title: My primary SSIC code is on the list of permitted services. Why is my business resumption status not reflected as “Permitted”?
    content: |
      You may not have updated your primary SSIC code recently. Please write in to <a href = "mailto: Covid_GoBusiness@mti.gov.sg">Covid_GoBusiness@mti.gov.sg</a> for assistance.
  - title: What if my business activities do not fall under what is stated as permitted services for the SSIC code of my company’s primary business activity?
    content: |
      Your company may resume the business activities that are on the list of permitted services.

      If your company’s business activities do not fall under the permitted services for the SSIC code of your company’s primary business activity, you will need to apply for a General Exemption and these activities must remain suspended until further notice.
  - title: I checked my exemption/resumption status and there is now a "Period" specified next to my "Permitted" status. What does this mean?
    content: |
      If your exemption/resumption status is “Permitted from (date)”, you will only be allowed to resume operations from the specified date. If your exemption/resumption status is “Permitted”, you are allowed to continue your operations immediately.
