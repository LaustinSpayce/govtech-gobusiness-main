  - title: Are non-corporate entities (eg. clubs, societies, charities, Social Service Agencies, co-operative societies) also allowed to resume work-related events?
    content: |
      Yes, all permitted enterprises are allowed to resume work-related events of up to 50 persons at their own workplaces or premises, and at third-party venues. Respective sectoral advisories and safe management measures continue to apply. For more information, please refer <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/safe-management-measures" target="_blank">here</a>.
  - title: Are fundraising events allowed to take place?
    content: |
      Yes, fundraising events may take place at the organiser’s own premises or third-party venues, with up to 50 persons per event.

      Fundraising activities that are not standalone fundraising events but are conducted as part of the course of other activities should follow the guidelines and safe management measures set for the primary activity. For example, fundraising carried out by commercial participators in the course of their retail business should follow the prevailing guidelines in place for retail activities. Similarly, the collection of offerings/tithes during religious services should follow the prevailing guidelines for the conduct of religious services. For more information, please refer <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/safe-management-measures" target="_blank">here</a>.
  - title: I have submitted Safe Management plans for my religious organisation (RO) during Phase One. Do I need to submit another plan for Phase Two?
    content: |
      Yes. As Phase Two involves the gradual resumption of congregational and worship services, as well as other non-congregational worship activities, all ROs are required to submit their Safe Management Plan, including manpower deployment, at least 3 days before resumption of Phase Two activities. ROs who have already submitted their safe management plan in Phase One only need to submit a shorter plan to cover the additional safe management measures for Phase Two activities. Please refer to <a href="https://www.cpro.gov.sg/" target="_blank">www.cpro.gov.sg</a> for details.

      ROs requesting deviations from the parameters set out in MCCY’s 18 Jun 2020 advisory on resumption of more religious activities in Phase Two will require MCCY’s approval before proceeding with their activities.

      MCCY will conduct enforcement checks and action will be taken against ROs who do not comply with the relevant guidelines, including the cessation of operations.
  - title: My religious organisation (RO) was not open during Phase One and I did not submit my Phase One Safe Management Plans. Am I allowed to proceed with Phase Two activities?
    content: |
      - Your RO has to submit a Safe Management Plan, including manpower deployment, at least 3 days before commencing Phase Two activities.
      - ROs who wish to deviate from the parameters set out in MCCY’s 18 Jun 2020 advisory on resumption of more religious activities in Phase Two will require MCCY’s approval before proceeding with their activities.
      - MCCY will conduct enforcement checks and action will be taken against ROs who do not comply with the relevant guidelines, including the cessation of operations.
  - title: Are entertainment venues (eg. public entertainment venues, cinemas, theatres and attractions) allowed to resume operations?
    content: |
      The Government is taking a particularly cautious approach for entertainment establishments in the nightlife sector because large numbers of people are likely to come into close contact for prolonged periods of time, and often in enclosed spaces, as seen in the rapid spread of COVID-19 through nightclubs and pubs overseas.

      As businesses in the nightlife industry will not be able to reopen soon, companies in these sectors are strongly encouraged to re-examine their business models and undertake permitted activities instead. Businesses that are keen to do so can contact the relevant government agencies to understand the processes involved.

      Operators may wish to refer to sector-specific updates on this website, or visit the following agencies’ website for the latest updates:

  - title: Can performing arts resume their rehearsals? Is there a limit to the number of persons allowed during rehearsals?
    content: |
      Rehearsals will be allowed to resume, subject to limits on involvement and organisations/practitioners’ ability and readiness to adhere to safe management measures. These would be indicated in National Arts Council (NAC)’s upcoming advisory for the arts and culture sector.
  - title: Country clubs are allowed to open in Phase Two. Are all facilities within the country club allowed to open from 19 June 2020?
    content: |
      No. While country clubs are allowed to resume operations from 19 June 2020, their facilities can only resume operations when the same activities are allowed to resume in the public sphere. For instance, billiard facilities in the country clubs may open from 4 July 2020, in line with the reopening date of commercial billiard saloons. Other facilities such as karaoke rooms within the club must remain closed. The management of the country clubs are encouraged to adopt the same safe management measures for these facilities provided for the respective sectors to reduce risks of COVID-19 transmission. For more information, as well as a list of facilities allowed to re-open, please refer <a href="/images/covid/countryclubadvisory.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
  - title: When will events be allowed to resume?
    content: |
      Activities or settings where large numbers of people are likely to come into close contact, often in enclosed spaces and for prolonged periods of time, are still not allowed to resume in Phase Two as these settings can spawn large clusters of infections, given the number of close contacts between individuals during the course of such activities.

      STB has begun to engage relevant businesses and organisations on possible safe management measures to be taken for these activities or settings. STB will advise businesses and organisations on the approval processes and timelines for resumption at a later date.
  - title: Can I receive visitors to my home if I provide home-based services (eg. private dining, hairdressing services, tuition classes)?
    content: |
      Yes, home-based services are allowed. Like any other homes, homes offering services may receive up to 8 visitors per day. Service providers and visitors should wear masks and maintain a 1-metre distance.

      Home-based services that involve customers entering the home for a prolonged period (eg. private dining and hairdressing services) must use SafeEntry.
  - title: Can I allow people offering home-based services into my home? (eg. Repairman to fix water pipes/electricity/cable/air-conditioning issues/ part-time cleaner / gardener / tuition teacher/ day-time nanny caring for my child)? Can they visit more than 2 households per day?
    content: |
      Yes, these are home-based services that are allowed. They will count as part of the 8-person cap on visitors per day. Service providers are required to wear masks and maintain a 1-metre distance.

      Limiting visits to 2 other households per day applies to social visits, and does not apply to those who need to visit multiple households in the course of business or employment.
